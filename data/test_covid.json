The epidemic curve of a total of 199 confirmed cases was drawn, classifying individuals into passengers with and without close contact and crew members. A backcalculation method was employed to estimate the incidence of infection. The peak time of infection was seen for the time period from 2 to 4 February 2020, and the incidence has abruptly declined afterwards. The estimated number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small from 5 February on which a movement restriction policy was imposed. Without the intervention from 5 February, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with and without close contact would have been as large as 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively, while these were kept to be 102 and 47 cases, respectively. Based on an analysis of illness onset data on board, the risk of infection among passengers without close contact was considered to be very limited. Movement restriction greatly reduced the number of infections from 5 February onwards.\n\nText: An outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has occurred on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess [1] . The primary case remains unknown, but the index case, defined as the first identified case, is a passenger who started coughing from 19 January 2020 on board, disembarking the ship in Hong Kong on 25 January. As the case was diagnosed on 1 February, the ship was requested to remain in the ocean near Yokohama from 3 February onwards. Subsequently, the movement of all passengers was restricted on board from 5 February, for a matter of 14 days of quarantine. Out of a total of 3711 persons (consisting of 2666 passengers and 1045 crew members), 199 symptomatic cases have been diagnosed on board as of 24 February, and additional asymptomatic infections and symptomatic cases after disembarkation have also been reported.\n\nOne of the critical issues in infectious disease epidemiology is that the time of infection event is seldom directly observable. For this reason, the time of infection needs to be statistically estimated, employing a backcalculation method [2] . Using a sophisticated statistical model with doubly intervalcensored likelihood and right truncation with an exponential growth of cases, the mean incubation period has been estimated to be about 5.0 days [3] . To understand the time-dependent risk of infection throughout the course of outbreak and estimate the effectiveness of the quarantine measure from 5 to 19 February 2020, I aimed to estimate the incidence of infection with COVID-19 and also predict the likely number of infections prevented by the quarantine measure.\n\nI analyzed the epidemic curve, ct, on day t, illustrated by the number of confirmed cases by the date of illness onset. The confirmatory diagnosis was made, using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The date of illness onset was defined as the first date of fever. In addition to the date of illness onset, cases were classified by contact history inside the cabin and also by the type of membership, i.e., crew or passenger. Close contact was defined as having at least one cabinmate who was confirmed by RT-PCR.\n\nWe estimate the number of cases by time of infection, it. Using the probability mass function of the incubation period of length s, fs, the incidence of infection is known to satisfy\n\nwhere E(.) represents the expected value. As for fs, it is known that the mean and standard deviation are 5.0 and 3.0 days, respectively, best fitted by lognormal distribution [3] . Employing a step function, the incidence of infection was statistically estimated via a maximum likelihood method. The estimation was implemented independently by the history of contact and type of membership.\n\nRegarding the real-time forecasting, we employed the so-called Richards model, an analogue to the generalized logistic model [4, 5] :\n\nwhere is the cumulative incidence on day t, Z is the cumulative incidence at the end of the outbreak, s is the parameter that governs the flexibility of the logistic curve, a is the early growth rate of cases and ti is the inflection point of the cumulative incidence curve. Assuming that the cumulative incidence is Gaussian distributed, four unknown parameters were estimated. The Richards model was fitted to two different datasets, i.e., (i) the dataset of the entire course of the epidemic and (ii) the dataset by 4 February 2020. The latter dataset corresponds to the time period without any impact of movement restriction that was in place from 5 February onwards. Figure 1 shows the epidemic curve by contact history and type of membership. The highest incidence of illness onset was observed on 7 February. The epidemic curve in a latter half period was dominated by crew members whose movement was not strictly controlled due to the need to continue service on the ship. The second dominating group was passengers with close contact history. The last illness onset date on board of a passenger without close contact was on 14 February. Estimating the incidence of infection, the peak incidence was identified for the period from 2 to 4 February among passengers both with and without close contact (Figure 2 ). The incidence of infection abruptly dropped after 5 February, the date of movement restriction. Among passengers without close contact, the incidence was estimated to be zero, except for 8-10 February 2020, during which 0.98 persons (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0, 7.74) per day were estimated to have been infected. The epidemic peak among crew members was seen for the period from 8 to 10 February 2020. Figure 3 compares the cumulative incidence with and without movement restriction policy from 5 February. In the presence of intervention, the cumulative incidence among passengers with and without close contact and crew members were 102, 47 and 48 cases, respectively, as of 24 February 2020. These were well realized by the Richards model. Without intervention from 5 February onwards, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with and without close contact would have been 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively. \n\nA large outbreak of COVID-19 occurred on a cruise ship. Estimating the incidence, the peak time of infection was shown to have been from 2 to 4 February, and the incidence abruptly declined afterwards. The estimated number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small from 5 February, on which the movement restriction policy was imposed, and at most there was, on average, one case of infection per day from 8 to 10 February. Other than continued exposure among crew members, the estimated incidence in this study indicates that the movement restriction policy from 5 February 2020 was highly successful in greatly reducing the number of secondary transmissions on board. Based on an analysis of illness onset data on board (and before the disembarkation of a large number of passengers), the risk of infection among passengers without close contact was considered to be very limited Among disembarked passengers, symptomatic cases have started to be reported on the ground in and outside of Japan. In particular, cases arising from passengers without close contact indicate a possible pathway of infection via mechanisms that were not covered by the abovementioned analysis that relied on symptomatic cases. Although the transmission via direct human-to-human contact was prevented by movement restrictions, the role of other modes of transmission, e.g., environmental and asymptomatic transmissions, should be further explored. \n\nThe author declares no conflict of interest.", "document_id": 2555}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When was the a cluster of pneumonia cases were first reported ?", "id": 1235, "answers": [{"text": "31 December 2019,", "answer_start": 1124}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the number of inbound passengers from China?", "id": 1236, "answers": [{"text": " 63.1 million per year in 2017 ", "answer_start": 3413}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What percent of inbound passengers from China were from Wuhan?", "id": 1237, "answers": [{"text": "2.1%", "answer_start": 3466}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The Extent of Transmission of Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, 2020\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020330\n\nSHA: 919c524f19f79213e6f81aa38502c70287d273dc\n\nAuthors: Nishiura, Hiroshi; Jung, Sung-mok; Linton, Natalie M.; Kinoshita, Ryo; Yang, Yichi; Hayashi, Katsuma; Kobayashi, Tetsuro; Yuan, Baoyin; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.\nDate: 2020\nDOI: 10.3390/jcm9020330\nLicense: cc-by\n\nAbstract: A cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported by China in late December 2019. Reported case incidence has now reached the hundreds, but this is likely an underestimate. As of 24 January 2020, with reports of thirteen exportation events, we estimate the cumulative incidence in China at 5502 cases (95% confidence interval: 3027, 9057). The most plausible number of infections is in the order of thousands, rather than hundreds, and there is a strong indication that untraced exposures other than the one in the epidemiologically linked seafood market in Wuhan have occurred.\n\nText: Since the announcement of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, was made on 31 December 2019, many rapid virological, clinical, and epidemiological research responses have taken place [1, 2] . The causative agent of the pneumonia is suggested to be a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) of the same lineage (but genetically distinct) from the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] . Cases in the initial cluster reported a common exposure-a seafood market in Wuhan where wild animals were served at a restaurant-indicating that a point-source zoonotic (animal-to-human) route was likely the main mode of transmission for those cases [2] .\n\nAlthough early reports from Wuhan [3] stated that (i) there were only tens of cases in the cluster and (ii) no human-to-human transmission was directly observed, the scientific community was alert to the possibility that the novel coronavirus would spread to other geographic locations-including other countries-via direct human-to-human transmission. In early January, the outbreak began to escalate rapidly with hundreds of cases now confirmed along with the presence of a few household clusters [4] [5] [6] [7] .\n\nAs of 24 January 2020, the cumulative incidence in China is 830 cases, of which 549 cases were diagnosed in Hubei, 26 in Beijing, 20 in Shanghai, and 53 in Guangdong. Additionally, twenty-six deaths have been linked to the outbreak [6, 8] , and thirteen cases were exported to Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States as of 22 January 2020. Considering that enhanced surveillance has been underway in these importing countries, case ascertainment has been perhaps better in exported case data.\n\nUsing a spatial back-calculation method and analyzing exported cases, we estimate the cumulative incidence of 2019-nCoV cases in China in real time, allowing us to update and discuss the extent of transmission at the source. Table 1 shows the incidence of exported cases by date of hospitalization and report. Due to the initial difficulty of diagnosis in the absence of established primer for polymerase chain reaction testing, the time lag between hospitalization and reporting was longer for early cases compared with that of more recent cases. Among the seven locations reporting importation, the total volume of inbound passengers from China was m = 63.1 million per year in 2017 [9] , of which 100q = 2.1% were from Wuhan [10] , a home of n = 19.0 million people as the catchment population of Wuhan airport. Two other locations with confirmed cases, i.e., Macau and Hong Kong, were excluded from the analysis, because it is commutable by land transporation and the first case in Hong Kong was indeed not via airtravel. As we already know from elsewhere [11] [12] [13] , given the observed cumulative count of c exported cases, we have a balance equation of the cumulative risk of infection:\n\nwhere T is the sum of incubation and infectious periods, and here is assumed to be 3.2 and 9.3 days [14] , respectively, assuming that these periods are similar to those of other coronaviruses, and thus, T = 12.5 days. The estimated incidence in China is then given bypn. With an ad-hoc assumption that the data are generated following the binomial sampling process among travelers from Wuhan, the cumulative incidence is then estimated using a maximum likelihood method. Table 1 also shows the estimated incidence in China. The first exportation event in Thailand suggests 423 cases with the upper confidence limit of 1863 cases. The estimated cumulative incidence has grown as additional cases have been reported. As of 24 January 2020, with reports of thirteen exportation events, the cumulative incidence in China is estimated at 5502 cases (95% confidence interval: 3027, 9057).\n\nOur latest estimate is comparable to a preliminary report posted by a research group at Imperial College London (ICL) on their own homepage on 22 January 2020 [26] that estimated the incidence based on three importation events at 4000 cases (95% CI: 1000, 9700). Possible reasons for the slight difference include (i) the number of travelers in the previous study was derived from airline passenger data [27] and (ii) the assumed length of T was different. Two other estimates have also been published: a preliminary study by a Northeastern University group estimated 1250 cases (95% CI: 350, 3000) as of 17 January 2020 [28] and a University of Hong Kong group estimated 1343 cases (95% CI: 547, 3446) as of 17 January 2020 [29] . The former study from the United States assumes that the catchment area population is 10 million (we use 11.1 million).\n\nThe number of reported 2019-nCoV infections continues to grow as surveillance and detection methods improve. Our estimate and others [26, 28, 29] agree that the actual number of cases is likely in the order of thousands, rather than hundreds, and there is a strong indication that untraced exposures other than that of the originally linked seafood market in Wuhan have occurred. Such exposures are expected to include human-to-human transmission, but the levels of transmissibility have yet to be quantified. It is still plausible that a substantial number of human infections arose from animal-to-human exposures, such as was the case during the first outbreak of highly pathogenic influenza (H7N9) in China, 2013, and the human-to-human transmissibility has yet to be quantified in an explicit manner.\n\nDespite initially restricting what information on the outbreak was shared publicly, the Chinese government has begun to respectfully provide updates on the situation on a daily basis. This encourages the real-time release of information by means of regularly updated situation reports, including epidemiological information with dates of exposure, illness onset, and hospitalization among cases.\n\nFor researchers to be able to contribute to control efforts by improving situation awareness via an explicit risk assessment, it is crucial that detailed epidemiological data are posted to a public domain in real-time. Such datasets should include not only a deidentified line list of cases but also updates on the infection status of traced contacts. Information on exposure period and illness onset can assist with the estimation of important natural history parameters such as the incubation period. It is critical for the public health community and the public at large to understand more about the process of case ascertainment, including the current case definition and reporting system mechanisms. \n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "document_id": 2554}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the mechanism of action for rupintrivir?", "id": 314, "answers": [{"text": "prevents cleavage of viral proteins required for replication", "answer_start": 9113}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Has rupintrivir been shown to reduce the symptoms of a rhinoviral infection?", "id": 315, "answers": [{"text": "in studies of natural infection, it did not significantly affect viral loads or symptom severity", "answer_start": 9308}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the primary etiology of acute respiratory infection?", "id": 308, "answers": [{"text": "viral", "answer_start": 2812}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is RSV?", "id": 309, "answers": [{"text": "respiratory syncytial virus", "answer_start": 3119}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What virus is most commonly associated with acute respiratory infections?", "id": 310, "answers": [{"text": "human rhinovirus", "answer_start": 3933}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What viruses are most frequently associated with acute respiratory infections?", "id": 311, "answers": [{"text": "HRVs, coronaviruses (CoV), influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIV)", "answer_start": 4174}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are the clinical characteristics of asthma?", "id": 313, "answers": [{"text": "chronic airway inflammation, and a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough", "answer_start": 6732}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What risk factor was associated with hospitalization and death during the 2009 H1N1 influence pandemic?", "id": 317, "answers": [{"text": "morbid obesity", "answer_start": 11203}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many surface proteins are on the H1N1 influenza virus?", "id": 319, "answers": [{"text": "two", "answer_start": 12711}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are the 2 surface proteins on the H1N1 influenza virus?", "id": 320, "answers": [{"text": "haemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) ", "answer_start": 12737}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What pharmaceutical targets the NA glycoprotein of the H1N1 influenza virus?", "id": 322, "answers": [{"text": "oseltamivir", "answer_start": 14280}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What genetic mutation decreases a person's susceptibility to the H1N1 influenza virus?", "id": 323, "answers": [{"text": "H275Y", "answer_start": 14705}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why is ribavirin treatment limited?", "id": 324, "answers": [{"text": "difficulty with aerosol delivery, cost and potential harm to healthcare workers", "answer_start": 16533}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The human viral challenge model: accelerating the evaluation of respiratory antivirals, vaccines and novel diagnostics\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6013893/\n\nSHA: f13c88733ea45be9e923a282dfd42f8c277c187c\n\nAuthors: Lambkin-Williams, Rob; Noulin, Nicolas; Mann, Alex; Catchpole, Andrew; Gilbert, Anthony S.\nDate: 2018-06-22\nDOI: 10.1186/s12931-018-0784-1\nLicense: cc-by\n\nAbstract: The Human Viral Challenge (HVC) model has, for many decades, helped in the understanding of respiratory viruses and their role in disease pathogenesis. In a controlled setting using small numbers of volunteers removed from community exposure to other infections, this experimental model enables proof of concept work to be undertaken on novel therapeutics, including vaccines, immunomodulators and antivirals, as well as new diagnostics. Crucially, unlike conventional phase 1 studies, challenge studies include evaluable efficacy endpoints that then guide decisions on how to optimise subsequent field studies, as recommended by the FDA and thus licensing studies that follow. Such a strategy optimises the benefit of the studies and identifies possible threats early on, minimising the risk to subsequent volunteers but also maximising the benefit of scarce resources available to the research group investing in the research. Inspired by the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) now commonly applied in the preclinical phase, HVC studies allow refinement and reduction of the subsequent development phase, accelerating progress towards further statistically powered phase 2b studies. The breadth of data generated from challenge studies allows for exploration of a wide range of variables and endpoints that can then be taken through to pivotal phase 3 studies. We describe the disease burden for acute respiratory viral infections for which current conventional development strategies have failed to produce therapeutics that meet clinical need. The Authors describe the HVC model\u2019s utility in increasing scientific understanding and in progressing promising therapeutics through development. The contribution of the model to the elucidation of the virus-host interaction, both regarding viral pathogenicity and the body\u2019s immunological response is discussed, along with its utility to assist in the development of novel diagnostics. Future applications of the model are also explored. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s12931-018-0784-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nText: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) manifest as Upper (URI) or Lower (LRI) respiratory tract infections and may move between the two compartments; ARIs represent the most common infectious diseases and are predominantly of viral aetiology. The global burden of ARI is substantial with significant morbidity and mortality occurring in children, the elderly and immunocompromised [1] .\n\nIn the UK alone during the period 2014-2015, respiratory disease caused an estimated 15,800 excess winter deaths [2] . In the USA, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause substantial mortality especially among people aged 65 and older [3] .\n\nHowever, although deaths in the industrialised world are widely reported, developing countries feel the burden particularly; out of an estimated 1.9 million child deaths from ARIs in 2000, 70% of those deaths occurred in Africa and south-east Asia [4] . The Millennium Summit at the United Nations in 2000 led to the setting up of the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nA study reported the progress made in meeting those goals in 40 developing countries; it concluded that the prevalence of ARI was 13%, health expenditure and per capita gross domestic product is directly associated with the prevalence of the disease [5] .\n\nViral heterogeneity associated with ARIs is well established [6] . In the past, human rhinovirus (HRV) has been identified as the virus most frequently associated with respiratory illness with 30-50% of infections annually on average, and up to 80% of upper respiratory infections during the autumn outbreaks [7] . After HRVs, coronaviruses (CoV), influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) are the next most frequent.\n\nMore recently an evaluation of illness in 6,266 children under ten years of age in Australia, South East Asia and Latin America emphasised both the viral heterogeneity and the impact of ARI. Of the 2,421 children who experienced 3,717 individual influenza-like Illness (ILI) episodes, rhinovirus/enterovirus was most prevalent (41. 5%). Influenza followed this (15.8%), adenovirus (ADV) (9.8%), PIV and RSV (both 9.7%), CoV (5.6%), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (5.5%) and human bocavirus (HBoV) (2.0%). The percentage of children missing school or childcare was between 21.4% for HBoV and 52.1% for influenza [8] .\n\nWe have compared the data from the two reports one from 2003 [7] and the other in 2017 [8] and found that the reports, despite being separated by 14 years, were similar, with the single exception of HBoV, discovered in 2005 (Table 1) , which we discuss later.\n\nFeng et al. [9] described in detail the distribution of ARIs causing hospitalisation by age group: they observed that RSV was predominantly observed in the young and elderly, and influenza although significant in the young was noticeably more predominant in the elderly. Interestingly they observed that co-detection of viruses tended to occur more commonly in the younger age groups, particularly those under the age of five.\n\nRhinovirus (the \"common\" cold) HRV infections, often considered trivial can significantly contribute to missed days from work and school, though infections are typically self-limiting [7] . HRV infections throughout the year and in many cases, manifest with symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. HRV is known to be the primary cause of ARI and a severe contributing factor in exacerbations of atopic disease, e.g., asthma as well other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [10] [11] [12] [13] .\n\nHRV infections are associated with significant economic implications as well as being an important contributor to sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis and primary pneumonia [14] [15] [16] . HRV is a considerable cause of morbidity in specific at-risk groups such as infants, the elderly, immunocompromised, and, as already mentioned, chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD and cystic fibrosis. At present, HRV is considered the number one cause of asthma exacerbations [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .\n\nAsthma is a complex disease, characterised by chronic airway inflammation, and a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough. Over time these symptoms can vary in their intensity [20] . Each year over 300 million people worldwide are affected by asthma: approximately 250,000 people die as a result. Many deaths are due to suboptimal long-term medical care and delay in obtaining help during severe exacerbations of the disease [21] . Treatments to prevent worsening of symptoms and other therapies for mild to moderate asthma that avert relapse, i.e., the symptoms worsen again when the treatment stops, are significant unmet medical needs.\n\nThe human challenge model has been used to investigate the viral pathogenicity [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] and recent publications on the asthma challenge model have focused on how the asthmatic host responds to HRV infection. Work is ongoing as to susceptibility to viral induced asthma worsening [27, 28] innate immune dysregulation [29] and induction of innate, and type 2 responses in nasal and bronchial epithelial secretions [30] . The pathogenesis of rhinoviral infection, along with other ARIs, in exacerbations of airway disease, has been investigated extensively. Impaired host responses to virus infection, a better understanding of the mechanisms of abnormal immune responses and the potential to develop novel therapeutic targets for virus-induced exacerbations have all used the HVC model [12, [31] [32] [33] [34] .\n\nDespite previous research work on multiple small molecule antivirals, such as pleconaril which have been tested using both the experimental challenge model and field studies [35] [36] [37] , there is currently no licensed treatment for HRV infections Other compounds have been tested against HRV, such as Vapendavir (BTA798) which prevented the release of viral RNA into the target cell and demonstrated a reduction in peak viral load in the HVC model [38] . A subsequent study in asthmatics was completed and although not published the compound did have a limited effect [39] .\n\nPirodavir an intranasal capsid-binding molecule reached phase 3 clinical trials for HRV prevention and treatment in the 1990s. Although the compound decreased viral replication and shedding, it failed to show a significant reduction in the duration or severity of symptoms [40, 41] .\n\nA Protease inhibitor, rupintrivir thats prevents cleavage of viral proteins required for replication was tested in an HRV challenge trial. Rupintrivir was well tolerated and reduced viral loads and respiratory symptoms [36] . However, in studies of natural infection, it did not significantly affect viral loads or symptom severity [42] .\n\nTreatments such as zinc-containing products are now widely discredited as demonstrated by the withdrawal of a Cochrane report and JAMA editorial [43] [44] [45] .\n\nCurrent treatment of HRV infections primarily consists of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines to manage symptoms. There is also no licensed vaccine, and while there has been some progress on developing multivalent vaccines [46] , development in this area is hampered by the sheer number of serotypes that need to be covered (at present over 160). Despite HRV being associated with up to 50% of adult asthma exacerbations and up to 80% of childhood exacerbations, there are no HRV-specific asthma therapies [34] .\n\nAs we better understand the interaction between the virus and the host, new therapies such as the monoclonal antibodies (anti-IgE [omalizumab] and anti-IL-5 [mepolizumab]) along with small molecules carefully targeting specific immune signalling pathways, HRV-specific prophylactic treatment may become practical [47] [48] [49] [50] .\n\nIn order to prevent exacerbations, the design of new therapeutics could potentially improve efficacy by both directly acting to inhibit viral replication and alleviate the symptoms of asthma and COPD [51] .\n\nInfluenza virus is a well-known human pathogen and can cause severe morbidity and mortality, particularly in older patients, those with co-morbidities and in the immunocompromised. In 2009, the first pandemic virus of the 21 st century hospitalised 195,000 to 403,000 in the US alone resulting in 8,870 to 18,300 deaths by mid-2010 [52] . A World Health Organization (WHO) global pooled analysis of 70,000 laboratory-confirmed hospitalised H1N1 pandemic patients from 19 countries revealed that of the 9,700 patients admitted to intensive care units, 2,500 died, and that morbid obesity might be a risk factor for hospitalisation and/or death [52] . Obesity was confirmed as a factor associated with a higher likelihood of admission to hospital in influenzainfected patients [53] .\n\nThe 2009 pandemic was considered mild. However, the classic W shaped age distribution curve of infection for a pandemic virus was observed. That is high mortality in the very young and the old, but an additional spike in death amongst the \"young and healthy\". The pandemic, as did previous outbreaks, occurred in successive waves, but despite national policies favouring the use of antiviral drugs, few patients received these before admission to hospital, and many were given antibiotics [54] . The lack of real, or perceived, \"real world\" efficacy of currently available antivirals leads to the overuse of antibiotics and the subsequent problems that may arise [55] [56] [57] .\n\nThe yearly seasonal morbidity and mortality of influenza results in hospitalisation and death mainly among the high-risk groups. Each year epidemics of seasonal influenza are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths worldwide [58] .\n\nIn first world / industrialised countries, most deaths associated with influenza occur among people age 65 or older [59] . Clinics and hospitals, in many countries, can be overwhelmed during peak illness periods, and there can be substantial economic cost [60] .\n\nThe virus itself has been well characterised, and the two surface proteins, the haemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) are important in both vaccine and antiviral development [61] .\n\nThe effects of seasonal influenza epidemics in developing countries are not fully known, but research estimates that 99% of deaths in children under five years of age with influenza-related lower respiratory tract infections are found in developing countries [59, 62] .\n\nCurrently, vaccines and antivirals exist for the prevention and treatment of influenza, but both have limitations in efficacy due to the rapid evolution of the virus as it mutates on a yearly basis and the sudden unexpected emergence of pandemic influenza strains.\n\nThe effectiveness of recent annual influenza vaccines (to date mostly based on the HA, and rarely the NA surface glycoproteins) has languished between 37% and 70% over successive influenza seasons. In particular, the failure of the vaccine across the winter season of 2014-2015, where the overall adjusted effectiveness was 23% [95% confidence interval 14, 31] [63] is memorable. In a mismatched year, the mortality rate is increased in the most at-risk populations [64, 65] . The problem of ensuring that the seasonal vaccine is correctly matched to the upcoming circulating strain highlights the need for rapid development of inter-seasonal/universal vaccines and also the need for a way of testing their efficiency rapidly and accurately before the lengthy and expensive mass production is engaged which takes many months [66, 67] .\n\nAntiviral drugs exist of which currently the NA inhibitor oseltamivir is most commonly used. This is active against all known NA subtypes of influenza, and one would, therefore, assume against all influenza strains. They may have decreasing effect with the emergence of resistant influenza strains in which NA protein changes preventing efficient oseltamivir binding and thus its ability to inhibit the essential activity of the viral NA. For example, one genetic mutation known as 'H275Y'a substitution of histidine for tyrosine at NA position 275 -confers an evolutionary advantage to the virus including the 2009 H1N1 influenza [68] . During the 2013-2014 influenza season, 59 (1.2%) of 1,811 influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus isolates in 20 of 50 US states had the H275Y oseltamivir resistance substitution. No isolates were resistant to zanamivir [69] . Although animal studies have demonstrated limited transmission of mutant viruses [70, 71] , it is thought that the rise of oseltamivir resistance may be due to community transmission [72, 73] rather than the H275Y mutation becoming fixed in the viral genome.\n\nAsystematic systematic review and meta-analysis of published data from 2000 onwards concluded that most RSV-associated child deaths occur particularly in preterm infants and in infants up to 1-year of age [62, 74] . An effective maternal RSV vaccine or monoclonal antibody could have a substantial effect on disease burden in this age group [75] .\n\nThe RSV-specific monoclonal antibody palivizumab is approved for prevention of serious LRI caused by RSV in susceptible infants. Economic benefit in a UK health setting has not been shown due to the high cost and lack of benefit on serious outcomes [76] . A single-centre cohort study of 22 infants showed no difference in treatment outcomes for patients receiving palivizumab when compared to patients only receiving \"standard of care\" treatment [77] . Despite the lack of evidence for clinical benefit, post-licensure data supports the use of palivizumab for reducing RSV-associated hospitalisations in premature infants under 33 weeks and in children with chronic lung and heart diseases [78] . Importantly, palivizumab resistant mutant virus has rarely been isolated in clinical specimens [79] .\n\nThe RSV treatment ribavirin is limited due to difficulty with aerosol delivery, cost and potential harm to healthcare workers, despite off-label treatment of immunocompromised patients being reasonably successful. In the immunocompromised, therapy with a concomitant immunoglobulin or palivizumab has had mixed results, probably due to the difficulty of knowing when to initiate treatment [80] .\n\nDespite the call for the accelerated development of prevention and treatment strategies for an effective RSV vaccine for children [81] , research has stalled for decades since the death in the 1960s of two subjects in a clinical study. These subjects were infected with a communityacquired RSV infection after receiving the US National Institutes for Health (NIH's) formalin-inactivated, alumprecipitated RSV candidate vaccine.\n\nIn contrast to influenza for which vaccines to date have shown themselves to be moderately effective but in need of improvement, RSV vaccines require substantially more research. There is currently no licensed vaccine for RSV; the most advanced candidate vaccine recently failed to show efficacy in a field study [82] . Effective treatments are urgently required.\n\nRSV is, even amongst healthcare professionals, considered a childhood disease and other confounders have obscured the understanding of the consequences of RSV in adults.\n\nRSV is poorly understood as a disease in the elderly [83] , and while the morbidity and mortality in children are of importance, it has been clearly shown that RSV has a comparable health burden to influenza in the elderly [84] .\n\nAs an example, a recent study was conducted on adult (\u226518 years) patients admitted to an emergency department with suspected ARI during 2013-2015 (N = 3743). Multiplex PCR was used to diagnose the cause of the respiratory infection. Eighty-seven patients were identified with RSV. A comparator group with influenza (n=312) was utilised. Based on a 20-day all-cause mortality endpoint, adult patients were less likely to be diagnosed with RSV than with flu (2.3 vs 8.3%, respectively), also they were older, often diagnosed with pneumonia, COPD, hypoxemia, and bacterial co-infection. RSV infection in the elderly was significantly associated with a greater risk of death than seasonal influenza, adjusted for potential confounders and comorbidities. [85] \n\nThe clinical significance of viral/bacterial co-infections has long been a controversial topic. While severe bacterial pneumonia following influenza infection has been well described, associations are less clear among infections caused by viruses common in young children; secondary infections due to other viruses are less well understood and has been reviewed by others [86] . Although assessing the overall contribution of bacteria to disease severity is complicated by the presence of many confounding factors in clinical studies, understanding the role of viral/bacterial co-infections in defining the outcome of paediatric ARI may potentially reveal novel treatment and prevention strategies, improving patient outcomes [33, [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] .\n\nA recent (2017) publication considered the role of bacterial colonisation with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis during symptomatic and asymptomatic viral upper respiratory infection in the nasopharynx of 4 to 7-year-old children during URI and when well. Using a multiplex PCR, virus was detected in about 80% of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) in children and is also detectable in the nasopharynx of 30% of asymptomatic children. All three bacteria \"levels\" were higher during acute URI visits compared to asymptomatic surveillance visits by the children. Of note, however, is that even during asymptomatic follow-up visits, if the virus was present, all bacteria were detected at higher levels [96] .\n\nIt is worth noting that the presence of confounding infections, can mask the importance of the primary aetiology. Taylor et al. [8] report the incidence of HBoV following its identification in 2005 from the respiratory tract samples of children, as an important respiratory pathogen in children. However, the role of this virus on its own as a pathogen of significance was initially unclear, co-infection with other viruses or bacteria was common and confounding.\n\nMoesker et al. [97] studied whether HBoV alone could cause acute respiratory infections in children. Using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), they were able to exclude co-infections amongst those admitted to intensive care unit and studied HBoV viral loads. Of the 990 children who tested positive for a respiratory virus by RT-PCR, HBoV and RSV were detected in 178 and 366 of the children respectively. Forty-nine HBoV-positive patients and 72 RSV-positive patients were admitted to the intensive care. Seven HBoV-infected cases with severe ARI had no other co-infection (7/49, 14%). Importantly, these children did not have another detectable virus as determined by highly sensitive NGS. Also, they had much higher HBoV loads than other patients positive for HBoV, i.e., those with a co-infection. Although small, this study provides strong support that HBoV can cause serious ARI in children with no viral and bacterial co-infections.\n\nThe history of the human viral challenge model Since Sir Edward Jenner performed the first documented HVC study with smallpox on the 14 th of May 1796 the usefulness of such studies has been apparent [98] . More than a century later, Sir Christopher Andrews returned from the US in 1931 he had observed the use of chimpanzees in the study of influenza. The funding for similar work in the UK was insufficient, and therefore Sir Christopher enrolled students from St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. He explained the next best thing would be a \"Bart's\" student as \"they were cheaper than chimpanzees\". Over 100 students immediately enrolled, but continued their studies and were not isolated in the same way the chimpanzees had been in the USA [99] . Unfortunately the investigators believed that the symptoms observed may not have been due to the challenge virus, but other respiratory infections acquired in the community, thus confounding the studies. A year later the UK's Medical Research Council (MRC) terminated the work.\n\nAfter the conclusion of World War II, the withdrawal of the US troops from the UK left the American Red Cross 'Harvard Hospital' Field Unit on Salisbury plain. The hospital became the Common Cold Unit (CCU) led by Dr David Tyrell, from 1946, volunteers were inoculated by instilling small quantities of the virus into their noses [100] . The CCU housed healthy volunteers in relative isolation from other people, thereby reducing the risk of contact with community-acquired sources of infection or from them passing on the virus to members of the public. The unit was eventually closed in 1989; during four decades of research, it attracted 20,000 volunteers. Its research contributed to a better understanding of respiratory viruses, viral lifecycle, possible vaccines [101] as well as the first licensed antiinfluenza compound amantadine [102] .\n\nThe use of healthy volunteers in the HVC model provided, and still offers, a unique opportunity to describe the viral lifecycle. Investigators know with certainty the time of infection, nasal virus shedding can be measured, symptoms recorded prospectively, and participants are selected with low pre-existing immunity to the challenge virus to ensure a statistically significant infection rate with a small number of volunteers. Thus, such studies can maximise the safety and efficacy data obtained while minimising the risk to study volunteers and limited research funding.\n\nAlthough serum IgG, for influenza virus, was traditionally measured via the HAI assay, as the entry criteria for volunteers into studies, micro neutralisation assays are used for RSV and HRV. Other work does suggest screening for antibodies to the NA influenza surface protein should be considered [103] or T-cell responses to internal proteins [104] should be considered.\n\nAfter the closure of the CCU experimental infection studies continued in the USA using small motels and hotels replacing the huts on Salisbury Plain. These studies contributed to the significant development of the new NA inhibitors during the 1990s, including the inhaled drug zanamivir and the orally available drug oseltamivir [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] .\n\nStudies however also continued in the UK, specifically the University of Southampton who performed important work in atopic volunteers, demonstrating they had more severe colds when experimentally challenged with rhinovirus, than non-atopic controls [115] .\n\nThe experimental A/Texas H1N1 influenza virus that was used successfully during the 1990s was implicated in the development of myocarditis in an experimentally infected subject, although a causal link was never demonstrated [116] . However, this incident halted work in the USA for a substantial period.\n\nMost, if not all, challenge viruses are manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standard. Although controlled nasal inoculation differs from naturally occurring infectionin which exposure to variable quantities of the virus may occur at various mucosal sites -the developed HVC model used in challenge studies mimics natural disease as far as possible [25, 117, 118] .\n\nWe have described the production of a new GMP stock of virus using an HRV-16 isolate from an 18-year-old experimentally infected healthy female volunteer, provided by colleagues from University of Virginia Children's Hospital, USA. Importantly, the clinical sample was provided with the appropriate medical history and consent of the donor. We manufactured this new HRV-16 stock by minimal passage in a WI-38 cell line, to reduce the risk of mutations during the Good Manufacturing Practice process. Having first subjected the stock to rigorous adventitious agent testing and determining the virus suitability for human use, we conducted an initial \"safety and pathogenicity\" clinical study in adult volunteers in a dedicated clinical quarantine facility in London [118] .\n\nOur group started HVC studies in the UK in 2001, and since then we have conducted multiple studies with over 2,500 volunteers inoculated with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or human rhinovirus (HRV), and provided numerous proofs of concept [119] [120] [121] .\n\nThe human viral challenge model: shortening the drug development pathway for ARIs Influenza, RSV and HRV infection have similar symptomatology, but this differs in severity and predominance of upper, lower or systemic symptoms as has been described by the Center for Disease Control [122] . However, it is not easy to diagnose between the different aetiologies of ARIs, and better diagnostics are needed [123] .\n\nSymptoms are common to each infection and manifest on a gradient. Generally, but far from always, influenza infection is more likely to result in a patient feeling so unwell as to take to their bed and have a fever, than RSV, an HRV, CoV or other common cold virus infection, during which daily life is usually less impacted.\n\nA variety of animal models exist to research respiratory viruses such as influenza [124] [125] [126] , RSV [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] , HRV [22, [138] [139] [140] . No single animal offers a platform for all respiratory viruses that infect humans, and different animal models exist for the same virus, which can give different, often conflicting results.\n\nIn addition, the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) were developed over 50 years ago to provide guidance and ensure humane animal research. Over time they have become national and international legislation/regulations. The policies of organisations that fund or conduct animal research include these principles as part of the condition of funding [141] .\n\nThe shared symptomatology of respiratory viruses requires a single standard research platform that can be used to evaluate respiratory disease pathogenesis and the efficacy of candidate therapeutics. The use of a dedicated, purpose-built 24 en-suite bedroom isolation facility in which carefully screened volunteers can be safely inoculated with challenge viruses and intensively monitored may help reduce the use of animals while providing a single consistent research platform with standardised evaluable endpoints for respiratory virus research. Also, we have used a standardised diary card across our studies, which allows for comparison of the symptoms that each virus causes and the efficacy of the therapeutic being tested. We have included a copy of the diary card in the Additional file 1.\n\nIt is difficult to evaluate the efficacy of a specific antiviral therapeutic \"in the field\" due to the presence of circulating community co-infections of differing microbial aetiology. The HVC model allows the opportunity to study a virus in isolation. HVC studies and field studies are complementary research stratagems necessary for the development of effective ARI therapeutics.\n\nIn contemporary HVC trials, (Fig. 1 ) healthy volunteers are administered an investigational therapeutic either before (prophylaxis trials) or after (treatment trials) inoculation with the specific challenge strain of the virus. The viruses used in the HVC model are not attenuated and produce symptoms consistent with clinically observed ARI [25, 117, 118] . Each virus is propagated under GMP conditions, with a minimal number of passages from the isolates to the challenge stocks [118, 142] . The few mutations that occur within the virus are rapidly selected out due to a genetic bottleneck, with the consequence that the virus in the human host is considered wild-type [143] . The similarity between virus recovered from the inoculated host and the originator reference virus strain provides assurance that the model disease process is closely aligned with the reference virus strain and is not altered nor attenuated.\n\nThere are limited licensed therapeutic options against respiratory viruses, highlighting a significant unmet medical need. A model such as the HVC allows the rapid evaluation of novel therapeutics. The model shortens both preclinical and early clinical development phases by providing a better understanding of the host and pathogen's initial interaction and has the potential to make the necessary vaccines and medicines more rapidly available than traditional development approaches otherwise might.\n\nShortening the traditional development pathway through the early use of a Proof of Concept (PoC) study that incorporates the HVC model (Fig. 2) provides essential evaluable endpoints. Unlike conventional phase 1 studies which rarely include any assessment of efficacy, almost all HVC studies include evaluable efficacy endpoints such as reduction in AUC viral load (mainly recovered from upper respiratory tract samples such as nasal wash or nasopharyngeal swab), volunteer self-reported symptoms, peak symptom score, total symptom score amongst others. Small numbers of subjectsoften in the order of 30-45 per treatment group-are typically included in these rapid to execute short duration studies. The resulting safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data in controlled conditions, guide decisions on whether or not to progress to field studies, providing a most valuable set of data immediately after, or even as part of, the conventional phase 1 safety study.\n\nThe HVC model also opens a different development route alongside traditional phase 1 allowing rapid progress to statistically powered phase 2b studies that will generate the efficacy data needed to support licensing, while still providing suitable safety data. The FDA guidance on developing influenza therapeutics [144] states that challenge trials cannot take the place of efficacy (phase 2) trials. The guidance states; \"\u2026Challenge trials can provide useful exposure-response and safety information, as well as an opportunity to demonstrate pharmacological antiviral activity in humans under controlled conditions outside the influenza season. Specifically, data from challenge trials can contribute to dose selection for phase 2b and phase 3 trials, and provide the opportunity to explore the effects of different times of drug initiation relative to virus exposure...\".\n\nChallenge trial refinements are closing the gap between the experimental infection model and the natural infection setting. The HVC study duration of several weeks is shorter than a field-based phase 2 study that waits for a natural outbreak of the virus and the duration of which can be several months/years. These studies save Fig. 1 The Human Viral Challenge Model. The study typically consists of inputs, such as the volunteers, their selection criteria, isolation in quarantine and exposure to a GMP virus. There are two treatment options; a vaccination/prophylaxis with an antiviral or b treatment with an antiviral. Outputs from the study, summarised on the right, such as virus symptoms, virus shedding etc. X is the number of days before virus exposure vaccination may occur. Y is the number of days post virus exposure that a volunteer may be followed for development time when the transition between phases is fully optimised.\n\nImportantly, unlike traditional phase 1b/phase 2 studies, HVC studies are not dependent on a natural outbreak of infection, which can occur at random, and for which the exact time of infection may not be apparent. They provide evaluable endpoints, comparative PD and PK data, along with additional biomarker data on product performance in humans. It must, however, be stated that most often such studies enrol otherwise healthy young adults which imply that the outcome of the infection in the placebo group may be seen as mild to moderate, to some extent. The safety of volunteers has to remain the priority of investigators.\n\nThe HRV/HVC model can be a potent tool, not just to study HRV infection and disease, but also to investigate the mechanisms of exacerbation in patients with chronic respiratory disease and to conduct efficacy studies for new therapies.\n\nHuman challenge studies with HRV have been shown to produce infection in over 90% of serologically susceptible subjects and result in a clinical syndrome that is comparable to that reported with natural colds [145, 146] . Symptoms usually appear within 24 hours and peak at 48-72 hours after inoculation. Virus shedding follows a pattern similar to that of their symptoms. In recent times, several hundred inoculations of adult subjects have been reported and have established this as a safe and effective method in which to study HRV-related disease in both healthy and asthmatic subjects [145] .\n\nThese studies have provided a knowledge base to further develop the HRV experimental model and provide a controlled and useful tool to develop new therapies for the disease areas associated with HRV infection. New treatments for asthma and COPD are urgently needed, and small animal models of asthma are poorly predictive of efficacy. Most drugs that are effective in these animal models are not found to be effective in later stages of development in humans. Models that more closely follow clinical features of human asthma and COPD are needed [32, [147] [148] [149] [150] [151] ].\n\nWe have already described current influenza antiviral drugs that can shorten disease and reduce the severity of symptoms if taken early enough after infection, and their prophylactic use can decrease the risk of infection; their utility has been debated however [152] .\n\nThe two main classes of currently effective antiinfluenza drugs are the NA inhibitors, such as zanamivir (Relenza\u2122), oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u2122), peramivir (Rapivab\u2122) [153] and M2 inhibitors, although drug resistance makes this class unusable [154] .\n\nThe HVC model has recently been used extensively to evaluate new classes of antiviral compounds against influenza, including those such as experimental monoclonal antibodies targeting epitopes within the highly conserved and exposed part of the M2 viral surface Fig. 2 The role of the HVC model in the clinical development pathway. Short duration proof of concept studies, which incorporate the HVC model, typically include small numbers of subjects. The resulting safety and, particularly, efficacy data can more accurately guide decisions on whether to expose a larger number of subjects to promising candidate therapeutics in field studies than conventional phase 1 safety data alone otherwise might protein [155, 156] the conserved stalk of the HA [157] and small molecule antiviral drugs that target the viral polymerase, e.g. favipiravir [158] .\n\nThe HVC model allows for the rapid evaluation of novel therapeutic compounds which may be difficult to evaluate in the field, due to the nature of \"at risk\" groups, e.g. paediatrics. Specifically, and given the described historical experience with RSV vaccines, it is important that benefit can first be demonstrated in a healthy population.\n\nIn the past, unlike influenza and HRV, the HVC model has not been routinely used with RSV. Recently, however, there are several antiviral therapeutics that have reached an advanced stage of development using the model.\n\nWe had for some time wished to restart the HVC/RSV studies at the University of London, the two significant challenges that had stalled antiviral development for RSV presented a considerable research need. In association with the DeVincenzo lab at the University of Tenessee and the biotech company Alnylam, we set about designing possibly the first HVC/RSV study.\n\nAlnylam pioneered the use of RNA interference (RNAi) which is a natural mechanism that regulates protein expression and is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNA). Working with both groups, we manufactured an RSV Type A virus to GMP standard and titrated it in 35 human volunteers who we divided into five groups, each which was intranasally inoculated with increasing titre (3.0-5.4 log plaque-forming units/person) of the challenge virus. Intranasally. Overall, in this new model, 77% of volunteers consistently shed virus. Infection rate, viral loads, disease severity, and safety were similar between cohorts and were unrelated to the quantity of RSV received.\n\nSymptoms began soon after initial viral detection, peaked in severity near when viral load peaked and subsided as viral loads slowly declined. We concluded that regardless of the titre administered once infections were established the viral load drove illness. We saw no adverse events linked to the virus [25] . Using this new model we conducted an HVC clinical study and demonstrated for the first time that an RNAi had significant antiviral activity against human RSV infection -this established the first-ever proof of concept for an RNAi therapeutic in humans adults [159] .\n\nAn editorial in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, described the utility of the HVC/RSV model saying; \"This model permits the relatively quick and efficient study of new therapeutics in humans and assists in making critical decisions whether to advance a product into costly human trials in populations at highest risk for disease; children, elderly or immunocompromised patients. This constitutes a major and welcome advance in the field of RSV.\" [81] It is notable that two compounds that have distinct modes of action have recently been evaluated using the HVC model.\n\nFirst-in-class nucleoside analogue ALS-008176, the efficacy of which was first demonstrated in the HVC model, is currently under evaluation in hospitalised infants [160, 161] . The HVC trial was of randomised, double-blind design, and studied healthy adults inoculated with RSV Memphis 37B [25] . A total of 62 participants received ALS-008176 or placebo for five days after confirmation of RSV infection by PCR (tested twice daily post inoculation). The primary endpoint was the area under the curve (AUC) for viral load post infection. More rapid RSV clearance and a greater reduction in viral load, with accompanying improvements in the severity of clinical disease, were demonstrated in the groups treated with ALS-008176 when compared to the placebo group [160] . Intensive sampling allowed for any potential mutations associated with resistance to be rapidly identified. No such resistant mutations were observed [160] .\n\nAn RSV-entry inhibitor, GS-5806, a second molecule, first-in-[its]-class was also evaluated. Among the 54 subjects that received active treatment, lower viral load, lower total mucus weight and a lower AUC symptom score were highly significant when compared to placebo [119] . Based on these challenge study data, this therapeutic is now also progressing into potentially pivotal field studies [162] .\n\nAn essential element of design in both studies was the timing of the first administration of therapeutic postexperimental virus inoculation; the timing was dependent on the detection of virus in nasal wash samples post inoculation of challenge virus by a rapid PCR assay [163] , rather than at an arbitrary time point. Subsequently the therapeutic was administered every 12 hours. Careful dose timing, at a clinically relevant point of detection, contributed to the positive outcomes of both studies. It is also believed that by using this \"triggered dosing\" model, it better mimicked what would happen in a clinical setting as symptoms are known to appear soon after the onset of virus shedding.\n\nThe HVC model is not limited to novel antiviral compounds but is also important for the evaluation of novel vaccines. Influenza vaccine performance in recent years raises questions about the most appropriate correlates of protection.\n\nUnlike field studies, HVC studies are useful tools for assessing the correlates of protection, vital for vaccine development [103, 104, 164] . Specifically, the importance of the humoral and cellular responses has been highlighted along with the pre-existing T-cell immunity for other respiratory viruses [104] .\n\nA recent publication describes the use of the HVC model to demonstrate the efficacy of a novel intranasal proteosome-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (P-TIV). In two separate studies, selected subjects who were na\u00efve to A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) virus, were dosed via nasal spray with one of three regimens of P-TIV or placebo. Together, the studies evaluated one or two doses, 15 \u03bcg or 30 \u03bcg, either once only or twice 14 days apart (1 x 30 \u03bcg, 2 x 30 \u03bcg, 2 x 15 \u03bcg) and subjects were challenged with A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) virus. Immune responses to the vaccine antigens were measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay and nasal wash secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies. Vaccine efficacy was observed ranging from 58% to 82%, comparable to traditional vaccines. The studies also demonstrate that protection against illness associated with evidence of influenza infection significantly correlated with pre-challenge HAI (serum IgG) titres (p = 0.0003) and mucosal IgA (p\u22640.0001) individually, and HAI (p = 0.028) and sIgA (p = 0.0014) together. HAI and sIgA levels were inversely related to rates of illness. These studies demonstrated the efficacy of this novel intranasal vaccine and answered some important questions concerning true correlates of protection against influenza infection which will help drive future vaccine design. As well as achieving its primary aims, it revealed valuable insights into the correlates of protection and will, we hope, aid future vaccine design [164] .\n\nAn inter-seasonal or universal influenza vaccine is desperately needed; it will save many lives, whether in those unexpected years when the recommended composition is not matched, or when a pandemic occurs, as it did in 2009. The significance of the 1918 pandemic [165, 166] makes it very clear; up to 100 million people died. A universal vaccine is one that can be prepared for the unexpected, a virus that occurs due to the reassortment of viral genes from different host species.\n\nThe HVC model is possibly the only way to initially test such a universal vaccine.\n\nA universal candidate could generate an immune response against the highly conserved virus ion channel protein M2, [167] [168] [169] [170] , although no vaccine has been shown to be effective in this regard; monoclonal antibodies alone have, the HVC model showed their efficacy [156] . Alternatively, a vaccine may target the conserved stalk of the HA protein [104, 171] , or elicit a T-cell response to the internal proteins [172] [173] [174] [175] . All are possibilities that have been and can be explored more efficiently using the HVC model.\n\nAlthough HVC studies provide PoC, researchers, as we have shown, have employed regulatory design standards typical of later phase efficacy studies.\n\nWith the development of molecular technology, it is now possible to refine the statistical analysis by stratifying the subjects based on their immune profile. For instance, it is now possible to assess whether a subject is carrying other known respiratory pathogens (bacteria, viruses etc.) and if there is a possible impact on the set of results from the volunteer. Subjects often consent for further analysis of their samples, which allows a valuable biobank of samples to be built for further testing. Moving forward, such samples will allow the use of the HVC model to understand further what happens when a virus infects a person.\n\nIt is worth noting that the HVC model is not limited to PoC work on potential therapeutic agents; it is also extensively being used for research purposes, upon which improved treatments for respiratory viruses can be built. In recent years it has been used to demonstrate \"gene switching signatures\" that could form part of a diagnostic that would reveal infected individuals before they become symptomatic, in the early stages of infection; this could be vitally important in the event of a pandemic [176, 177] .\n\nAlso, the HVC model has been used to allow a comparison of the relative disease dynamics of different respiratory viruses [24] and to provide a better understanding of the interaction of the virus and the human host [26, 178, 179] .\n\nThe HVC model has increased our understanding of the viral life cycle and disease pathogenesis in a tightly controlled setting using small numbers of volunteers. Each volunteer is isolated from each other, and the wider community, ensuring that the disease under consideration is the only one of interest.\n\nThe applicability of the virus used to challenge volunteers in the HVC model to a virus that an individual might become exposed to in the \"real world\" is significant. Whether challenge trials are feasible is dependent on the availability of adequately safety-tested challenge virus strains that are of know providence.\n\nThe HVC model provides certain knowledge of the character of the virus; the exact time point of infection; measurability of nasal virus shedding; prospective recording of symptoms and pre-selection of participants for viral challenge who are sero-suitable. This ensures that a statistically significant rate of infection is achieved with the minimal number of volunteers, thus optimising the risk-benefit ratio that supports the determination of therapeutic efficacy.\n\nCrucial to HVC study design is the timing of administration of the first dose of product under investigation to determine optimal effectiveness, not just in the challenge study itself, but in both later stage clinical studies and final clinical use.\n\nThe HVC model is an important tool in drug development, in particular with regard to acute respiratory infections. It can accelerate the development of therapeutics that address multiple unmet medical needs. It helps in the understanding of the relationship between a virus and its human host and offers the potential for the development of early-stage diagnostics. It contributes towards identifying new areas for therapeutic intervention. Possibly, and arguably, more importantly, it can ensure that scarce medical resources are directed towards later stage clinical development in an evidence-based manner, and promising therapeutic opportunities are prioritised.\n\nA careful and targeted study design process is a crucial step towards the successful outcome of a challenge trial, because almost all parameters, can be either controlled or at least known (either pre-or post-hoc). Furthermore, results from such trials can be used to make commercial decisions and can lead to major publications, expanding the collective understanding of the scientific community.\n\nSamples from such experiments are of immense value to researchers for the understanding of host interaction mechanisms and the development and validation of therapeutics. Utilisation of consistently collected historical data from HVC studies informs the accurate design and powering of subsequent studies.\n\nHVC studies have been successful in providing proof of concept for DNA vaccines, T-cell vaccines, intranasal vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and small molecules against a range of important respiratory viruses.\n\nIt is also encouraging to see that the HVC model is now expanding into further patient populations such as the elderly, asthmatics and those with other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nAn expanding archive of data from preceding studies is an invaluable asset to assist in the selection of volunteers, decide on appropriate endpoints and refine future field study designs.\n\nThis allows for safer, statistically sound and more rapidly delivered research. drafted the initial version of this manuscript with author RLW. hVIVO was responsible for overall management of this work and verified the accuracy of the data presented.

The serial interval was not precisely estimated, and a potentially shorter mean serial interval would have corresponded to a slightly lower basic reproductive number. Control measures and changes in population behaviour later in January should have reduced the effective reproductive number. However, it is too early to estimate whether the effective reproductive number has been reduced to below the critical threshold of 1 because cases currently being detected and reported would have mostly been infected in mid- to late-January. Average delays between infection and illness onset have been estimated at around 5\u20136 days, with an upper limit of around 11-14 days [2,5], and delays from illness onset to laboratory confirmation added a further 10 days on average [2].\n\nText: It is now 6 weeks since Chinese health authorities announced the discovery of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1] causing a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, the major transport hub of central China. The earliest human infections had occurred by early December 2019, and a large wet market in central Wuhan was linked to most, but not all, of the initial cases [2] . While evidence from the initial outbreak investigations seemed to suggest that 2019-nCoV could not easily spread between humans [3] , it is now very clear that infections have been spreading from person to person [2] . We recently estimated that more than 75,000 infections may have occurred in Wuhan as at 25 January 2020 [4] , and increasing numbers of infections continue to be detected in other cities in mainland China and around the world. A number of important characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection have already been identified, but in order to calibrate public health responses we need improved information on transmission dynamics, severity of the disease, immunity, and the impact of control and mitigation measures that have been applied to date.\n\nInfections with 2019-nCoV can spread from person to person, and in the earliest phase of the outbreak the basic reproductive number was estimated to be around 2.2, assuming a mean serial interval of 7.5 days [2] . The serial interval was not precisely estimated, and a potentially shorter mean serial interval would have corresponded to a slightly lower basic reproductive number. Control measures and changes in population behaviour later in January should have reduced the effective reproductive number. However, it is too early to estimate whether the effective reproductive number has been reduced to below the critical threshold of 1 because cases currently being detected and reported would have mostly been infected in mid-to late-January. Average delays between infection and illness onset have been estimated at around 5-6 days, with an upper limit of around 11-14 days [2, 5] , and delays from illness onset to laboratory confirmation added a further 10 days on average [2] .\n\nChains of transmission have now been reported in a number of locations outside of mainland China. Within the coming days or weeks it will become clear whether sustained local transmission has been occurring in other cities outside of Hubei province in China, or in other countries. If sustained transmission does occur in other locations, it would be valuable to determine whether there is variation in transmissibility by location, for example because of different behaviours or control measures, or because of different environmental conditions. To address the latter, virus survival studies can be done in the laboratory to confirm whether there are preferred ranges of temperature or humidity for 2019-nCoV transmission to occur.\n\nIn an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases of infection, 73% of cases with illness onset between 12 and 22 January reported no exposure to either a wet market or another person with symptoms of a respiratory illness [2] . The lack of reported exposure to another ill person could be attributed to lack of awareness or recall bias, but China's health minister publicly warned that pre-symptomatic transmission could be occurring [6] . Determining the extent to which asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission might be occurring is an urgent priority, because it has direct implications for public health and hospital infection control. Data on viral shedding dynamics could help in assessing duration of infectiousness. For severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), infectivity peaked at around 10 days after illness onset [7] , consistent with the peak in viral load at around that time [8] . This allowed control of the SARS epidemic through prompt detection of cases and strict isolation. For influenza virus infections, virus shedding is highest on the day of illness onset and relatively higher from shortly before symptom onset until a few days after onset [9] . To date, transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV appear more similar to influenza, with contagiousness occurring around the time of symptom onset, rather than SARS.\n\nTransmission of respiratory viruses generally happens through large respiratory droplets, but some respiratory viruses can spread through fine particle aerosols [10] , and indirect transmission via fomites can also play a role. Coronaviruses can also infect the human gastrointestinal tract [11, 12] , and faecal-oral transmission might also play a role in this instance. The SARS-CoV superspreading event at Amoy Gardens where more than 300 cases were infected was attributed to faecal-oral, then airborne, spread through pressure differentials between contaminated effluent pipes, bathroom floor drains and flushing toilets [13] . The first large identifiable superspreading event during the present 2019-nCoV outbreak has apparently taken place on the Diamond Princess cruise liner quarantined off the coast of Yokohama, Japan, with at least 130 passengers tested positive for 2019-nCoV as at 10 February 2020 [14] . Identifying which modes are important for 2019-nCoV transmission would inform the importance of personal protective measures such as face masks (and specifically which types) and hand hygiene.\n\nThe first human infections were identified through a surveillance system for pneumonia of unknown aetiology, and all of the earliest infections therefore had Modelling studies incorporating healthcare capacity and processes pneumonia. It is well established that some infections can be severe, particularly in older adults with underlying medical conditions [15, 16] , but based on the generally mild clinical presentation of 2019-nCoV cases detected outside China, it appears that there could be many more mild infections than severe infections. Determining the spectrum of clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV infections is perhaps the most urgent research priority, because it determines the strength of public health response required. If the seriousness of infection is similar to the 1918/19 Spanish influenza, and therefore at the upper end of severity scales in influenza pandemic plans, the same responses would be warranted for 2019-nCoV as for the most severe influenza pandemics. If, however, the seriousness of infection is similar to seasonal influenza, especially during milder seasons, mitigation measures could be tuned accordingly.\n\nBeyond a robust assessment of overall severity, it is also important to determine high risk groups. Infections would likely be more severe in older adults, obese individuals or those with underlying medical conditions, but there have not yet been reports of severity of infections in pregnant women, and very few cases have been reported in children [2] .\n\nThose under 18 years are a critical group to study in order to tease out the relative roles of susceptibility vs severity as possible underlying causes for the very rare recorded instances of infection in this age group. Are children protected from infection or do they not fall ill after infection? If they are naturally immune, which is unlikely, we should understand why; otherwise, even if they do not show symptoms, it is important to know if they shed the virus. Obviously, the question about virus shedding of those being infected but asymptomatic leads to the crucial question of infectivity. Answers to these questions are especially pertinent as basis for decisions on school closure as a social distancing intervention, which can be hugely disruptive not only for students but also because of its knock-on effect for child care and parental duties. Very few children have been confirmed 2019-nCoV cases so far but that does not necessarily mean that they are less susceptible or that they could not be latent carriers. Serosurveys in affected locations could inform this, in addition to truly assessing the clinical severity spectrum.\n\nAnother question on susceptibility is regarding whether 2019-nCoV infection confers neutralising immunity, usually but not always, indicated by the presence of neutralising antibodies in convalescent sera. Some experts already questioned whether the 2019-nCoV may behave similarly to MERS-CoV in cases exhibiting mild symptoms without eliciting neutralising antibodies [17] . A separate question pertains to the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection or of disease [18, 19] . If either of these were to be relevant, the transmission dynamics could become more complex.\n\nA wide range of control measures can be considered to contain or mitigate an emerging infection such as 2019-nCoV. Internationally, the past week has seen an increasing number of countries issue travel advisories or outright entry bans on persons from Hubei province or China as a whole, as well as substantial cuts in flights to and from affected areas out of commercial considerations. Evaluation of these mobility restrictions can confirm their potential effectiveness in delaying local epidemics [20] , and can also inform when as well as how to lift these restrictions.\n\nIf and when local transmission begins in a particular location, a variety of community mitigation measures can be implemented by health authorities to reduce transmission and thus reduce the growth rate of an epidemic, reduce the height of the epidemic peak and the peak demand on healthcare services, as well as reduce the total number of infected persons [21] . A number of social distancing measures have already been implemented in Chinese cities in the past few weeks including school and workplace closures. It should now be an urgent priority to quantify the effects of these measures and specifically whether they can reduce the effective reproductive number below 1, because this will guide the response strategies in other locations. During the 1918/19 influenza pandemic, cities in the United States, which implemented the most aggressive and sustained community measures were the most successful ones in mitigating the impact of that pandemic [22] .\n\nSimilarly to international travel interventions, local social distancing measures should be assessed for their impact and when they could be safely discontinued, albeit in a coordinated and deliberate manner across China such that recrudescence in the epidemic curve is minimised. Mobile telephony global positioning system (GPS) data and location services data from social media providers such as Baidu and Tencent in China could become the first occasion when these data inform outbreak control in real time.\n\nAt the individual level, surgical face masks have often been a particularly visible image from affected cities in China. Face masks are essential components of personal protective equipment in healthcare settings, and should be recommended for ill persons in the community or for those who care for ill persons. However, there is now a shortage of supply of masks in China and elsewhere, and debates are ongoing about their protective value for uninfected persons in the general community.\n\nThe Table summarises research gaps to guide the public health response identified.\n\nIn conclusion, there are a number of urgent research priorities to inform the public health response to the global spread of 2019-nCoV infections. Establishing robust estimates of the clinical severity of infections is probably the most pressing, because flattening out the surge in hospital admissions would be essential if there is a danger of hospitals becoming overwhelmed with patients who require inpatient care, not only for those infected with 2019-nCoV but also for urgent acute care of patients with other conditions including those scheduled for procedures and operations. In addressing the research gaps identified here, there is a need for strong collaboration of a competent corps of epidemiological scientists and public health workers who have the flexibility to cope with the surge capacity required, as well as support from laboratories that can deliver on the ever rising demand for diagnostic tests for 2019-nCoV and related sequelae. The readiness survey by Reusken et al. in this issue of Eurosurveillance testifies to the rapid response and capabilities of laboratories across Europe should the outbreak originating in Wuhan reach this continent [23] .\n\nIn the medium term, we look towards the identification of efficacious pharmaceutical agents to prevent and treat what may likely become an endemic infection globally. Beyond the first year, one interesting possibility in the longer term, perhaps borne of wishful hope, is that after the first few epidemic waves, the subsequent endemic re-infections could be of milder severity. Particularly if children are being infected and are developing immunity hereafter, 2019-nCoV could optimistically become the fifth human coronavirus causing the common cold.\n\nNone declared.", "document_id": 2526}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When is this especially true?", "id": 3963, "answers": [{"text": "when not all exacerbation events occurred during the viral infection but may also occur well after viral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Stolz et al., 2019) in particular the late onset of a bacterial infection", "answer_start": 15414}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the current understanding on viral-induced exacerbations?", "id": 3855, "answers": [{"text": "that viral infection increases airway inflammation which aggravates disease symptoms.", "answer_start": 749}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What have evoked new understandings as to the mechanisms of viral exacerbations?", "id": 3856, "answers": [{"text": "Recent advances in in vitro air-liquid interface 3D cultures, organoid cultures and the use of novel human and animal challenge models", "answer_start": 835}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is one of  the major sources of exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases?", "id": 3854, "answers": [{"text": "Respiratory virus infection", "answer_start": 491}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the focus of this review?", "id": 3857, "answers": [{"text": " recent novel findings that elucidate how respiratory viral infections alter the epithelial barrier in the airways, the upper airway microbial environment, epigenetic modifications including miRNA modulation, and other changes in immune responses throughout the upper and lower airways.", "answer_start": 1078}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What have the authors reviewed?", "id": 3858, "answers": [{"text": "the prevalence of different respiratory viral infections in causing exacerbations in chronic airway inflammatory diseases.", "answer_start": 1384}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is summarized?", "id": 3859, "answers": [{"text": "how recent models have expanded our appreciation of the mechanisms of viral-induced exacerbations.", "answer_start": 1539}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is highlighted by the authors?", "id": 3860, "answers": [{"text": "the importance of the virome within the airway microbiome environment and its impact on subsequent bacterial infection.", "answer_start": 1661}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is consolidated in this review?", "id": 3861, "answers": [{"text": "the understanding of viral induced exacerbation in chronic airway inflammatory diseases and indicates pathways that may be targeted for more effective management of chronic inflammatory diseases.", "answer_start": 1806}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is this disease  characterized by ?", "id": 3862, "answers": [{"text": " airway inflammation leading to complications such as coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.

These exacerbations are associated with high morbidity and even mortality worldwide. The current understanding on viral-induced exacerbations is that viral infection increases airway inflammation which aggravates disease symptoms. Recent advances in in vitro air-liquid interface 3D cultures, organoid cultures and the use of novel human and animal challenge models have evoked new understandings as to the mechanisms of viral exacerbations. In this review, we will focus on recent novel findings that elucidate how respiratory viral infections alter the epithelial barrier in the airways, the upper airway microbial environment, epigenetic modifications including miRNA modulation, and other changes in immune responses throughout the upper and lower airways. First, we reviewed the prevalence of different respiratory viral infections in causing exacerbations in chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Subsequently we also summarized how recent models have expanded our appreciation of the mechanisms of viral-induced exacerbations. Further we highlighted the importance of the virome within the airway microbiome environment and its impact on subsequent bacterial infection. This review consolidates the understanding of viral induced exacerbation in chronic airway inflammatory diseases and indicates pathways that may be targeted for more effective management of chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\nText: The prevalence of chronic airway inflammatory disease is increasing worldwide especially in developed nations (GBD 2015 Chronic Respiratory Disease Collaborators, 2017 Guan et al., 2018) . This disease is characterized by airway inflammation leading to complications such as coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. The disease can manifest in both the upper airway (such as chronic rhinosinusitis, CRS) and lower airway (such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD) which greatly affect the patients' quality of life (Calus et al., 2012; Bao et al., 2015) . Treatment and management vary greatly in efficacy due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease. This is further complicated by the effect of episodic exacerbations of the disease, defined as worsening of disease symptoms including wheeze, cough, breathlessness and chest tightness (Xepapadaki and Papadopoulos, 2010) . Such exacerbations are due to the effect of enhanced acute airway inflammation impacting upon and worsening the symptoms of the existing disease (Hashimoto et al., 2008; Viniol and Vogelmeier, 2018) . These acute exacerbations are the main cause of morbidity and sometimes mortality in patients, as well as resulting in major economic burdens worldwide. However, due to the complex interactions between the host and the exacerbation agents, the mechanisms of exacerbation may vary considerably in different individuals under various triggers. Acute exacerbations are usually due to the presence of environmental factors such as allergens, pollutants, smoke, cold or dry air and pathogenic microbes in the airway (Gautier and Charpin, 2017; Viniol and Vogelmeier, 2018) . These agents elicit an immune response leading to infiltration of activated immune cells that further release inflammatory mediators that cause acute symptoms such as increased mucus production, cough, wheeze and shortness of breath. Among these agents, viral infection is one of the major drivers of asthma exacerbations accounting for up to 80-90% and 45-80% of exacerbations in children and adults respectively (Grissell et al., 2005; Xepapadaki and Papadopoulos, 2010; Jartti and Gern, 2017; Adeli et al., 2019) . Viral involvement in COPD exacerbation is also equally high, having been detected in 30-80% of acute COPD exacerbations (Kherad et al., 2010; Jafarinejad et al., 2017; Stolz et al., 2019) . Whilst the prevalence of viral exacerbations in CRS is still unclear, its prevalence is likely to be high due to the similar inflammatory nature of these diseases (Rowan et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2017) . One of the reasons for the involvement of respiratory viruses' in exacerbations is their ease of transmission and infection (Kutter et al., 2018) . In addition, the high diversity of the respiratory viruses may also contribute to exacerbations of different nature and severity (Busse et al., 2010; Costa et al., 2014; Jartti and Gern, 2017) . Hence, it is important to identify the exact mechanisms underpinning viral exacerbations in susceptible subjects in order to properly manage exacerbations via supplementary treatments that may alleviate the exacerbation symptoms or prevent severe exacerbations.\n\nWhile the lower airway is the site of dysregulated inflammation in most chronic airway inflammatory diseases, the upper airway remains the first point of contact with sources of exacerbation. Therefore, their interaction with the exacerbation agents may directly contribute to the subsequent responses in the lower airway, in line with the \"United Airway\" hypothesis. To elucidate the host airway interaction with viruses leading to exacerbations, we thus focus our review on recent findings of viral interaction with the upper airway. We compiled how viral induced changes to the upper airway may contribute to chronic airway inflammatory disease exacerbations, to provide a unified elucidation of the potential exacerbation mechanisms initiated from predominantly upper airway infections.\n\nDespite being a major cause of exacerbation, reports linking respiratory viruses to acute exacerbations only start to emerge in the late 1950s (Pattemore et al., 1992) ; with bacterial infections previously considered as the likely culprit for acute exacerbation (Stevens, 1953; Message and Johnston, 2002) . However, with the advent of PCR technology, more viruses were recovered during acute exacerbations events and reports implicating their role emerged in the late 1980s (Message and Johnston, 2002) . Rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the predominant viruses linked to the development and exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Jartti and Gern, 2017) . Other viruses such as parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus (IFV) and adenovirus (AdV) have also been implicated in acute exacerbations but to a much lesser extent (Johnston et al., 2005; Oliver et al., 2014; Ko et al., 2019) . More recently, other viruses including bocavirus (BoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), certain coronavirus (CoV) strains, a specific enterovirus (EV) strain EV-D68, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) have been reported as contributing to acute exacerbations . The common feature these viruses share is that they can infect both the upper and/or lower airway, further increasing the inflammatory conditions in the diseased airway (Mallia and Johnston, 2006; Britto et al., 2017) .\n\nRespiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate within airway epithelial cells . During the replication process, the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche (Busse et al., 2010) . In a healthy airway, the inflammation normally leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. This eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection (Vareille et al., 2011; Braciale et al., 2012) . However, in a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation of their symptoms (Mallia and Johnston, 2006; Dougherty and Fahy, 2009; Busse et al., 2010; Britto et al., 2017; Linden et al., 2019) . This is usually further compounded by the increased susceptibility of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients toward viral respiratory infections, thereby increasing the frequency of exacerbation as a whole (Dougherty and Fahy, 2009; Busse et al., 2010; Linden et al., 2019) . Furthermore, due to the different replication cycles and response against the myriad of respiratory viruses, each respiratory virus may also contribute to exacerbations via different mechanisms that may alter their severity. Hence, this review will focus on compiling and collating the current known mechanisms of viral-induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases; as well as linking the different viral infection pathogenesis to elucidate other potential ways the infection can exacerbate the disease. The review will serve to provide further understanding of viral induced exacerbation to identify potential pathways and pathogenesis mechanisms that may be targeted as supplementary care for management and prevention of exacerbation. Such an approach may be clinically significant due to the current scarcity of antiviral drugs for the management of viral-induced exacerbations. This will improve the quality of life of patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases.\n\nOnce the link between viral infection and acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory disease was established, there have been many reports on the mechanisms underlying the exacerbation induced by respiratory viral infection. Upon infecting the host, viruses evoke an inflammatory response as a means of counteracting the infection. Generally, infected airway epithelial cells release type I (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2) and type III (IFN\u03bb) interferons, cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Matsukura et al., 2013) . These, in turn, enable infiltration of innate immune cells and of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) that will then in turn release specific mediators to facilitate viral targeting and clearance, including type II interferon (IFN\u03b3), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-12 (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Braciale et al., 2012) . These factors heighten local inflammation and the infiltration of granulocytes, T-cells and B-cells (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Braciale et al., 2012) . The increased inflammation, in turn, worsens the symptoms of airway diseases.\n\nAdditionally, in patients with asthma and patients with CRS with nasal polyp (CRSwNP), viral infections such as RV and RSV promote a Type 2-biased immune response (Becker, 2006; Jackson et al., 2014; Jurak et al., 2018) . This amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia, a key pathological driver of asthma and CRSwNP (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Chung et al., 2015; Dunican and Fahy, 2015) . Increased eosinophilia, in turn, worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to life-threatening conditions due to breathing difficulties. On the other hand, patients with COPD and patients with CRS without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) are more neutrophilic in nature due to the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Cukic et al., 2012; Brightling and Greening, 2019) . The pathology of these airway diseases is characterized by airway remodeling due to the presence of remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) released from infiltrating neutrophils (Linden et al., 2019) . Viral infections in such conditions will then cause increase neutrophilic activation; worsening the symptoms and airway remodeling in the airway thereby exacerbating COPD, CRSsNP and even CRSwNP in certain cases (Wang et al., 2009; Tacon et al., 2010; Linden et al., 2019) .\n\nAn epithelial-centric alarmin pathway around IL-25, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and their interaction with group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) has also recently been identified (Nagarkar et al., 2012; Hong et al., 2018; Allinne et al., 2019) . IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP are type 2 inflammatory cytokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon injury to the epithelial barrier (Gabryelska et al., 2019; Roan et al., 2019) . ILC2s are a group of lymphoid cells lacking both B and T cell receptors but play a crucial role in secreting type 2 cytokines to perpetuate type 2 inflammation when activated (Scanlon and McKenzie, 2012; Li and Hendriks, 2013) . In the event of viral infection, cell death and injury to the epithelial barrier will also induce the expression of IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, with heighten expression in an inflamed airway (Allakhverdi et al., 2007; Goldsmith et al., 2012; Byers et al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2013; Beale et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2014; Uller and Persson, 2018; Ravanetti et al., 2019) . These 3 cytokines then work in concert to activate ILC2s to further secrete type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 which further aggravate the type 2 inflammation in the airway causing acute exacerbation (Camelo et al., 2017) . In the case of COPD, increased ILC2 activation, which retain the capability of differentiating to ILC1, may also further augment the neutrophilic response and further aggravate the exacerbation (Silver et al., 2016) . Interestingly, these factors are not released to any great extent and do not activate an ILC2 response during viral infection in healthy individuals (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) ; despite augmenting a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed airways (Jurak et al., 2018) . These classical mechanisms of viral induced acute exacerbations are summarized in Figure 1 .\n\nAs integration of the virology, microbiology and immunology of viral infection becomes more interlinked, additional factors and FIGURE 1 | Current understanding of viral induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Upon virus infection in the airway, antiviral state will be activated to clear the invading pathogen from the airway. Immune response and injury factors released from the infected epithelium normally would induce a rapid type 1 immunity that facilitates viral clearance. However, in the inflamed airway, the cytokines and chemokines released instead augmented the inflammation present in the chronically inflamed airway, strengthening the neutrophilic infiltration in COPD airway, and eosinophilic infiltration in the asthmatic airway. The effect is also further compounded by the participation of Th1 and ILC1 cells in the COPD airway; and Th2 and ILC2 cells in the asthmatic airway.\n\nFrontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org mechanisms have been implicated in acute exacerbations during and after viral infection (Murray et al., 2006) . Murray et al. (2006) has underlined the synergistic effect of viral infection with other sensitizing agents in causing more severe acute exacerbations in the airway. This is especially true when not all exacerbation events occurred during the viral infection but may also occur well after viral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Stolz et al., 2019) in particular the late onset of a bacterial infection (Singanayagam et al., 2018 (Singanayagam et al., , 2019a . In addition, viruses do not need to directly infect the lower airway to cause an acute exacerbation, as the nasal epithelium remains the primary site of most infections. Moreover, not all viral infections of the airway will lead to acute exacerbations, suggesting a more complex interplay between the virus and upper airway epithelium which synergize with the local airway environment in line with the \"united airway\" hypothesis (Kurai et al., 2013) . On the other hand, viral infections or their components persist in patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Hence, their presence may further alter the local environment and contribute to current and future exacerbations. Future studies should be performed using metagenomics in addition to PCR analysis to determine the contribution of the microbiome and mycobiome to viral infections. In this review, we highlight recent data regarding viral interactions with the airway epithelium that could also contribute to, or further aggravate, acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases.\n\nPatients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases have impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance (Hammond et al., 2015; McKendry et al., 2016; Akbarshahi et al., 2018; Gill et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . Their impairment stems from a type 2-skewed inflammatory response which deprives the airway of important type 1 responsive CD8 cells that are responsible for the complete clearance of virusinfected cells (Becker, 2006; McKendry et al., 2016) . This is especially evident in weak type 1 inflammation-inducing viruses such as RV and RSV (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Additionally, there are also evidence of reduced type I (IFN\u03b2) and III (IFN\u03bb) interferon production due to type 2-skewed inflammation, which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components, or the live virus in the airway epithelium (Contoli et al., 2006; Hwang et al., 2019; Wark, 2019) . Due to the viral components remaining in the airway, antiviral genes such as type I interferons, inflammasome activating factors and cytokines remained activated resulting in prolong airway inflammation (Wood et al., 2011; Essaidi-Laziosi et al., 2018) . These factors enhance granulocyte infiltration thus prolonging the exacerbation symptoms. Such persistent inflammation may also be found within DNA viruses such as AdV, hCMV and HSV, whose infections generally persist longer (Imperiale and Jiang, 2015) , further contributing to chronic activation of inflammation when they infect the airway (Yang et al., 2008; Morimoto et al., 2009; Imperiale and Jiang, 2015; Lan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016; Kowalski et al., 2017) . With that note, human papilloma virus (HPV), a DNA virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis, is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies (de Visser et al., 2005; Gillison et al., 2012; Bonomi et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2015) . Therefore, the role of HPV infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, which is scarcely explored, should be investigated in the future. Furthermore, viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral genes may also lead to the development of steroid resistance, which is seen with RV, RSV, and PIV infection (Chi et al., 2011; Ford et al., 2013; Papi et al., 2013) . The use of steroid to suppress the inflammation may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Hammond et al., 2015; Hewitt et al., 2016; McKendry et al., 2016; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . The concomitant development of steroid resistance together with recurring or prolong viral infection thus added considerable burden to the management of acute exacerbation, which should be the future focus of research to resolve the dual complications arising from viral infection.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV (Yan et al., 2016; Guibas et al., 2018) and certain CoV (including the recently emerged COVID-19 virus) (Tao et al., 2013; Yue et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2020) , may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance. These infections, however, cause massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier, so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2019) . Factors such as RANTES and CXCL10, which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis, are strongly induced from IFV infected epithelium (Ampomah et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019) . Additionally, necroptotic factors such as RIP3 further compounds the cell deaths in IFV infected epithelium . The massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway (Guibas et al., 2018) . Moreover, the destruction of the epithelial barrier may cause further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations. Epithelial destruction may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors . Infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium, such as IFV, usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Fortunately, annual vaccines are available to prevent IFV infections (Vasileiou et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018) ; and it is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best means to prevent severe IFV induced exacerbation.\n\nAnother mechanism that viral infections may use to drive acute exacerbations is the induction of vasodilation or tight junction opening factors which may increase the rate of infiltration. Infection with a multitude of respiratory viruses causes disruption of tight junctions with the resulting increased rate of viral infiltration. This also increases the chances of allergens coming into contact with airway immune cells. For example, IFV infection was found to induce oncostatin M (OSM) which causes tight junction opening (Pothoven et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2018) . Similarly, RV and RSV infections usually cause tight junction opening which may also increase the infiltration rate of eosinophils and thus worsening of the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Sajjan et al., 2008; Kast et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018) . In addition, the expression of vasodilating factors and fluid homeostatic factors such as angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) and bactericidal/permeabilityincreasing fold-containing family member A1 (BPIFA1) are also associated with viral infections and pneumonia development, which may worsen inflammation in the lower airway Akram et al., 2018) . These factors may serve as targets to prevent viral-induced exacerbations during the management of acute exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases.\n\nAnother recent area of interest is the relationship between asthma and COPD exacerbations and their association with the airway microbiome. The development of chronic airway inflammatory diseases is usually linked to specific bacterial species in the microbiome which may thrive in the inflamed airway environment (Diver et al., 2019) . In the event of a viral infection such as RV infection, the effect induced by the virus may destabilize the equilibrium of the microbiome present (Molyneaux et al., 2013; Kloepfer et al., 2014; Kloepfer et al., 2017; Jubinville et al., 2018; van Rijn et al., 2019) . In addition, viral infection may disrupt biofilm colonies in the upper airway (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae) microbiome to be release into the lower airway and worsening the inflammation (Marks et al., 2013; Chao et al., 2014) . Moreover, a viral infection may also alter the nutrient profile in the airway through release of previously inaccessible nutrients that will alter bacterial growth (Siegel et al., 2014; Mallia et al., 2018) . Furthermore, the destabilization is further compounded by impaired bacterial immune response, either from direct viral influences, or use of corticosteroids to suppress the exacerbation symptoms (Singanayagam et al., 2018 (Singanayagam et al., , 2019a Wang et al., 2018; Finney et al., 2019) . All these may gradually lead to more far reaching effect when normal flora is replaced with opportunistic pathogens, altering the inflammatory profiles (Teo et al., 2018) . These changes may in turn result in more severe and frequent acute exacerbations due to the interplay between virus and pathogenic bacteria in exacerbating chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Wark et al., 2013; Singanayagam et al., 2018) . To counteract these effects, microbiome-based therapies are in their infancy but have shown efficacy in the treatments of irritable bowel syndrome by restoring the intestinal microbiome (Bakken et al., 2011) . Further research can be done similarly for the airway microbiome to be able to restore the microbiome following disruption by a viral infection.\n\nViral infections can cause the disruption of mucociliary function, an important component of the epithelial barrier. Ciliary proteins FIGURE 2 | Changes in the upper airway epithelium contributing to viral exacerbation in chronic airway inflammatory diseases. The upper airway epithelium is the primary contact/infection site of most respiratory viruses. Therefore, its infection by respiratory viruses may have far reaching consequences in augmenting and synergizing current and future acute exacerbations. The destruction of epithelial barrier, mucociliary function and cell death of the epithelial cells serves to increase contact between environmental triggers with the lower airway and resident immune cells. The opening of tight junction increasing the leakiness further augments the inflammation and exacerbations. In addition, viral infections are usually accompanied with oxidative stress which will further increase the local inflammation in the airway. The dysregulation of inflammation can be further compounded by modulation of miRNAs and epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that promote dysregulation in inflammation. Finally, the change in the local airway environment and inflammation promotes growth of pathogenic bacteria that may replace the airway microbiome. Furthermore, the inflammatory environment may also disperse upper airway commensals into the lower airway, further causing inflammation and alteration of the lower airway environment, resulting in prolong exacerbation episodes following viral infection. \n\nViral specific trait contributing to exacerbation mechanism (with literature evidence) Oxidative stress ROS production (RV, RSV, IFV, HSV)\n\nAs RV, RSV, and IFV were the most frequently studied viruses in chronic airway inflammatory diseases, most of the viruses listed are predominantly these viruses. However, the mechanisms stated here may also be applicable to other viruses but may not be listed as they were not implicated in the context of chronic airway inflammatory diseases exacerbation (see text for abbreviations).\n\nthat aid in the proper function of the motile cilia in the airways are aberrantly expressed in ciliated airway epithelial cells which are the major target for RV infection (Griggs et al., 2017) . Such form of secondary cilia dyskinesia appears to be present with chronic inflammations in the airway, but the exact mechanisms are still unknown (Peng et al., , 2019 Qiu et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, it was found that in viral infection such as IFV, there can be a change in the metabolism of the cells as well as alteration in the ciliary gene expression, mostly in the form of down-regulation of the genes such as dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 (DNAH5) and multiciliate differentiation And DNA synthesis associated cell cycle protein (MCIDAS) (Tan et al., 2018b . The recently emerged Wuhan CoV was also found to reduce ciliary beating in infected airway epithelial cell model (Zhu et al., 2020) . Furthermore, viral infections such as RSV was shown to directly destroy the cilia of the ciliated cells and almost all respiratory viruses infect the ciliated cells (Jumat et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) . In addition, mucus overproduction may also disrupt the equilibrium of the mucociliary function following viral infection, resulting in symptoms of acute exacerbation (Zhu et al., 2009) . Hence, the disruption of the ciliary movement during viral infection may cause more foreign material and allergen to enter the airway, aggravating the symptoms of acute exacerbation and making it more difficult to manage. The mechanism of the occurrence of secondary cilia dyskinesia can also therefore be explored as a means to limit the effects of viral induced acute exacerbation.\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional modulation of biological processes, and implicated in a number of diseases (Tan et al., 2014) . miRNAs are found to be induced by viral infections and may play a role in the modulation of antiviral responses and inflammation (Gutierrez et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2018) . In the case of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, circulating miRNA changes were found to be linked to exacerbation of the diseases (Wardzynska et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is likely that such miRNA changes originated from the infected epithelium and responding immune cells, which may serve to further dysregulate airway inflammation leading to exacerbations. Both IFV and RSV infections has been shown to increase miR-21 and augmented inflammation in experimental murine asthma models, which is reversed with a combination treatment of anti-miR-21 and corticosteroids (Kim et al., 2017) . IFV infection is also shown to increase miR-125a and b, and miR-132 in COPD epithelium which inhibits A20 and MAVS; and p300 and IRF3, respectively, resulting in increased susceptibility to viral infections (Hsu et al., 2016 (Hsu et al., , 2017 . Conversely, miR-22 was shown to be suppressed in asthmatic epithelium in IFV infection which lead to aberrant epithelial response, contributing to exacerbations (Moheimani et al., 2018) . Other than these direct evidence of miRNA changes in contributing to exacerbations, an increased number of miRNAs and other non-coding RNAs responsible for immune modulation are found to be altered following viral infections (Globinska et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2018; Hasegawa et al., 2018) . Hence non-coding RNAs also presents as targets to modulate viral induced airway changes as a means of managing exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Other than miRNA modulation, other epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation may also play a role in exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Recent epigenetic studies have indicated the association of epigenetic modification and chronic airway inflammatory diseases, and that the nasal methylome was shown to be a sensitive marker for airway inflammatory changes (Cardenas et al., 2019; Gomez, 2019) . At the same time, it was also shown that viral infections such as RV and RSV alters DNA methylation and histone modifications in the airway epithelium which may alter inflammatory responses, driving chronic airway inflammatory diseases and exacerbations (McErlean et al., 2014; Pech et al., 2018; Caixia et al., 2019) . In addition, Spalluto et al. (2017) also showed that antiviral factors such as IFN\u03b3 epigenetically modifies the viral resistance of epithelial cells. Hence, this may indicate that infections such as RV and RSV that weakly induce antiviral responses may result in an altered inflammatory state contributing to further viral persistence and exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Spalluto et al., 2017) .\n\nFinally, viral infection can result in enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the airway epithelium (Kim et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) . The airway epithelium of patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases are usually under a state of constant oxidative stress which sustains the inflammation in the airway (Barnes, 2017; van der Vliet et al., 2018) . Viral infections of the respiratory epithelium by viruses such as IFV, RV, RSV and HSV may trigger the further production of ROS as an antiviral mechanism Aizawa et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) . Moreover, infiltrating cells in response to the infection such as neutrophils will also trigger respiratory burst as a means of increasing the ROS in the infected region. The increased ROS and oxidative stress in the local environment may serve as a trigger to promote inflammation thereby aggravating the inflammation in the airway (Tiwari et al., 2002) . A summary of potential exacerbation mechanisms and the associated viruses is shown in Figure 2 and Table 1 .\n\nWhile the mechanisms underlying the development and acute exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory disease is extensively studied for ways to manage and control the disease, a viral infection does more than just causing an acute exacerbation in these patients. A viral-induced acute exacerbation not only induced and worsens the symptoms of the disease, but also may alter the management of the disease or confer resistance toward treatments that worked before. Hence, appreciation of the mechanisms of viral-induced acute exacerbations is of clinical significance to devise strategies to correct viral induce changes that may worsen chronic airway inflammatory disease symptoms. Further studies in natural exacerbations and in viral-challenge models using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) or single cell RNA-seq on a range of time-points may provide important information regarding viral pathogenesis and changes induced within the airway of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients to identify novel targets and pathway for improved management of the disease. Subsequent analysis of functions may use epithelial cell models such as the air-liquid interface, in vitro airway epithelial model that has been adapted to studying viral infection and the changes it induced in the airway (Yan et al., 2016; Boda et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018a) . Animal-based diseased models have also been developed to identify systemic mechanisms of acute exacerbation (Shin, 2016; Gubernatorova et al., 2019; Tanner and Single, 2019) . Furthermore, the humanized mouse model that possess human immune cells may also serves to unravel the immune profile of a viral infection in healthy and diseased condition (Ito et al., 2019; Li and Di Santo, 2019) . For milder viruses, controlled in vivo human infections can be performed for the best mode of verification of the associations of the virus with the proposed mechanism of viral induced acute exacerbations . With the advent of suitable diseased models, the verification of the mechanisms will then provide the necessary continuation of improving the management of viral induced acute exacerbations.\n\nIn conclusion, viral-induced acute exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory disease is a significant health and economic burden that needs to be addressed urgently. In view of the scarcity of antiviral-based preventative measures available for only a few viruses and vaccines that are only available for IFV infections, more alternative measures should be explored to improve the management of the disease. Alternative measures targeting novel viral-induced acute exacerbation mechanisms, especially in the upper airway, can serve as supplementary treatments of the currently available management strategies to augment their efficacy. New models including primary human bronchial or nasal epithelial cell cultures, organoids or precision cut lung slices from patients with airways disease rather than healthy subjects can be utilized to define exacerbation mechanisms. These mechanisms can then be validated in small clinical trials in patients with asthma or COPD. Having multiple means of treatment may also reduce the problems that arise from resistance development toward a specific treatment.", "document_id": 2504}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What clinical condition is caused by Hantaan virus?", "id": 546, "answers": [{"text": "hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome", "answer_start": 605}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the structure of Hantaan virus?", "id": 547, "answers": [{"text": "enveloped, negative-sense RNA virus", "answer_start": 24937}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What the animal vector reservoir for Hantaan virus?", "id": 548, "answers": [{"text": "rodents", "answer_start": 25187}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What diagnostic test is correlated with the severity of HFRS?", "id": 549, "answers": [{"text": "plasma viral load", "answer_start": 25635}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How is Interferon used in practice?", "id": 551, "answers": [{"text": "an antiviral medicine", "answer_start": 25927}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What genotypes are associated with the severity of HFRS?", "id": 552, "answers": [{"text": "rs12252 C allele and CC genotype", "answer_start": 26357}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which IFITM proteins have been shown to possess antiviral activity?", "id": 554, "answers": [{"text": "IFITM1, 2, and 3", "answer_start": 27495}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the hypothesized mechanism by which IFITMs work?", "id": 555, "answers": [{"text": "restrict viral infection at the stage of cellular entry", "answer_start": 28051}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What genotype causes truncation of the IFITM3 protein?", "id": 556, "answers": [{"text": "rs12252 C allele", "answer_start": 34574}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein 3 Inhibits Hantaan Virus Infection, and Its Single Nucleotide Polymorphism rs12252 Influences the Severity of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5206578/\n\nSHA: 4328e18bdf9b52875c87f3f5ddb1911636a192d2\n\nAuthors: Xu-yang, Zheng; Pei-yu, Bian; Chuan-tao, Ye; Wei, Ye; Hong-wei, Ma; Kang, Tang; Chun-mei, Zhang; Ying-feng, Lei; Xin, Wei; Ping-zhong, Wang; Chang-xing, Huang; Xue-fan, Bai; Ying, Zhang; Zhan-sheng, Jia\nDate: 2017-01-03\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2016.00535\nLicense: cc-by\n\nAbstract: Hantaan virus (HTNV) causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Previous studies have identified interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) as an interferon-stimulated gene family. However, the role of IFITMs in HTNV infection is unclear. In this study, we observed that IFITM3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs12252 C allele and CC genotype associated with the disease severity and HTNV load in the plasma of HFRS patients. In vitro experiments showed that the truncated protein produced by the rs12252 C allele exhibited an impaired anti-HTNV activity. We also proved that IFITM3 was able to inhibit HTNV infection in both HUVEC and A549 cells by overexpression and RNAi assays, likely via a mechanism of inhibiting virus entry demonstrated by binding and entry assay. Localization of IFITM3 in late endosomes was also observed. In addition, we demonstrated that the transcription of IFITM3 is negatively regulated by an lncRNA negative regulator of interferon response (NRIR). Taken together, we conclude that IFITM3, negatively regulated by NRIR, inhibits HTNV infection, and its SNP rs12252 correlates with the plasma HTNV load and the disease severity of patients with HFRS.\n\nText: associates with the severity of disease, indicating the importance of viremia in the pathogenesis of HFRS (2) . Therefore, further studies of host factors limiting HTNV infection and influencing antiviral response as well as disease progression are clinically significant and timely. The human family of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) was discovered 25 years ago to consist of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (3) . This family includes five members, namely, IFITM1, 2, 3, 5, and 10, among which IFITM1, 2, and 3 possess antiviral activity (4) . Different IFITM proteins have different antiviral spectrum (5) . For example, IFITM3 has been shown to prevent influenza virus infection in vitro and in mice (6, 7) , and it also inhibits multiple viruses, including filoviruses, rhabdoviruses, flaviviruses, and even Ebola and Zika virus (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . The antiviral mechanism of IFITM3 is thought to be the restriction of viral entry into cells (4, 12) . Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are single nucleotide variations in a genetic sequence that occur at an appreciable frequency in the population. Several SNPs has been identified in IFITM3, among which the rs12252 site with C allele results in a N-terminal truncation of IFITM3 protein, leading to impaired inhibition of influenza virus in vitro (13, 14) . Notably, the frequencies of rs12252 C allele and CC genotype correlate with disease severity in patients infected with influenza virus (13, 15) . HTNV has been shown to induce a type I interferon response (though in later time postinfection) (16, 17) . While overexpression of IFITM1, 2, and 3 in Vero E6 cells has been reported to inhibit HTNV infection (18) , however, the effect of IFITMs on HTNV infection in human cell lines and its role in HFRS still remain unknown.\n\nLncRNA comprises a group of non-coding RNAs longer than 200 nt that function as gene regulators. Some lncRNAs have been shown to play a role in innate immunity (19) . Among them, negative regulator of interferon response (NRIR) (lncRNA NRIR, also known as lncRNA-CMPK2) is a non-coding ISG that negatively regulates IFITM1 and Mx1 expression in HCV infection (20) . Notably, IFITM3 is largely homologous to IFITM1, but the role of NRIR in the regulation of IFITM3 in HTNV infection remains unclear.\n\nIn the present study, we investigate the effect of IFTTM3 on the replication of HTNV and its role in the development of HFRS in humans. We provide primary evidence suggesting that IFITM3, regulated by NRIR, can inhibit HTNV infection and its SNP rs12252 correlates with the disease severity and viral load in patients with HFRS. This study expands our understanding of the antiviral activity of IFITM3 and enriches our knowledge of innate immune responses to HTNV infection.\n\nThis study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the biomedical research guidelines involving human participants established by the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China. The Institutional Ethics Committee of Tangdu Hospital approved this study. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Before inclusion, all participants were informed of the study objectives and signed the consent form before blood samples and medical records were obtained.\n\nSixty-nine HFRS patients admitted into the Department of Infectious Diseases, Tangdu Hospital between October 2014 and March 2016 were enrolled in this study. All patients were Han Chinese. The diagnosis of HFRS was made based on typical symptoms and signs as well as positive IgM and IgG antibodies against HTNV in the serum assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in our department. The classification of HFRS severity and the exclusion criteria were described as follows (21) : white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr), and heteromorphic lymphocytes that were tested by the Department of Clinical Laboratory (shown in Table 1 ).\n\nAccording to clinical symptoms and signs, such as fever, effusion, hemorrhage, edema, and renal function, the severity of HFRS can be classified as previously described (21): (1) mild patients were identified with mild renal failure without an obvious oliguric stage; (2) moderate patients were those with obvious symptoms of uremia, effusion (bulbar conjunctiva), hemorrhage (skin and mucous membrane), and renal failure with a typical oliguric stage; (3) severe patients had severe uremia, effusion (bulbar conjunctiva and either peritoneum or pleura), hemorrhage (skin and mucous membrane), and renal failure with oliguria (urine output, 50-500 ml/day) for \u22645 days or anuria (urine output, <50 ml/day) for \u22642 days; and (4) critical patients exhibited \u22651 of the following signs during the illness: refractory shock, visceral hemorrhage, heart failure, pulmonary edema, brain edema, severe secondary infection, and severe renal failure with oliguria (urine output, 50-500 ml/day) for >5 days, anuria (urine output, <50 ml/day) for >2 days, or a BUN level of >42.84 mmol/l. Due to the sample quantity required for SNP typing, the mild and moderate patients were assessed together in the mild group, and we combined severe and critical patients as severe group.\n\nThe exclusion criteria for this study were patients with: (1) any other kidney disease, (2) diabetes mellitus, (3) autoimmune disease, (4) hematological disease, (5) cardiovascular disease, (6) viral hepatitis (types A, B, C, D, or E), or (7) any other liver disease. In addition, no patients received corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory drugs during the study period (21) .\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of patients using the PureGene DNA Isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The region encompassing the human IFITM3 rs12252 were amplified by PCR (forward primer, 5\u2032-GGAAACTGTTGAGAAACCGAA-3\u2032 and reverse primer, 5\u2032-CATACGCACCTTCACGGAGT-3\u2032). The PCR products were purified and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The allele frequencies and genotypes of healthy Han Chinese and other groups were obtained from the 1,000 genomes project (http:// www.1000genomes.org).\n\nThe HTNV load in plasma samples (collected during the acute phase) from 24 age-and sex-matched HFRS patients with different genotypes were measured using previously reported methods (2) . Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from the plasma of HFRS patients using Purelink Viral RNA/DNA Kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was employed for the real-time RT-PCR assay. The primers and probe (provided by Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) were as follows: forward, 5\u2032-TACAGAGGGAAATCAATGCC-3\u2032, reverse, 5\u2032-TGTTCAACTCATCTGGATCCTT-3\u2032, and probe, 5\u2032-(FAM) ATCCCTCACCTTCTGCCTGGCTATC (TAMRA)-3\u2032. The synthetic S segment of the HTNV standard strain 76-118 RNA transcript was used as the quantitative calibrator. The external standard was the culture supernatant of Vero E6 cells infected with HTNV 76-118, which was quantified using synthetic quantitative calibrators. For each experiment, one aliquot of calibrated 76-118 standard was extracted in parallel with the clinical samples and serially 10-fold diluted with concentrations ranging from 10.56 to 2.56 log10 copies/ml. PCR was performed using an iQ5 Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with following conditions: 42\u00b0C for 15 min, 95\u00b0C for 2 min, and 50 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 53\u00b0C, and 30 s at 72\u00b0C. Fluorescence was read during the 72\u00b0C step of the final segment of every cycling program.\n\nHUVEC cells (ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were grown in ECM BulletKit (ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a 5% CO2 incubator. A549 cells (ATCC Cat# CRM-CCL-185, RRID:CVCL_0023) were grown in our laboratory in DMEM with 10% FBS (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were used within passage 10 after primary culture. HTNV strain 76-118 was cultured in Vero E6 cells (ATCC Cat# CRL-1586, RRID:CVCL_0574) in our laboratory and titrated using an immunofluorescence staining assay for HTNV nucleocapsid protein (NP) as previously described (22) . The TCID50 was 10 5 /ml, which was calculated using the Reed-Muench method.\n\nThe recombinant human IFN-\u03b12a was obtained from PBL Interferon Source (Piscataway, NJ, USA) and dissolved in the buffer provided by the manufacturer (composition not disclosed). HUVEC and A549 cells were infected by incubation with HTNV as indicated moi at 37\u00b0C for 60 mins. Subsequently, the virus solution was removed and fresh medium added to the cell culture.\n\nCells were transfected with lentiviral vectors of c-myc-tagged IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, and IFITM3 N\u039421 (purchased from GENECHEM, Shanghai, China) at a moi of 10. Puromycin (2 \u03bcg/ ml for HUVEC and 6 \u03bcg/ml for A549 cells) was used to create cell lines stably expressing IFITMs. Cells were transfected with control (scrambled) short interfering RNA (siRNA), IFITM1 siRNA, IFITM2 siRNA, or IFITM3 siRNA (10 nM) using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). SiRNAs were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD, USA), and the sequences were not disclosed.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and cDNA was synthesized using the K1622 kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara Biotechnology Co., Dalian, China) with a Bio-Rad iQ5 cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). \u03b2-actin was used as the reference gene. The primers (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) were as follows: IFITM1 (forward, 5\u2032-ACTCCGTGAAGTCTAGGGACA-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-TGTCACAGAGCCGAATACCAG-3\u2032); IFITM2 (forward, 5\u2032-ATCCCGGTAACCCGATCAC-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-CTTCCTGTCCCTAGACTTCAC-3\u2032); IFITM3 (forward, 5\u2032-GGTCTTCGCTGGACACCAT-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-TGTCCCTAGACTTCACGGAGTA-3\u2032); IFITM3 pre-mRNA (forward, 5\u2032-CATAGCACGCGGCTCT CAG-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-CGTCGCCAACCATCTTCCTG-3\u2032); HTNV S segment (forward, 5\u2032-GCCTGGAGACCATCTGA AAG-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-AGTATCGGGACGACAAAGGA-3\u2032); \u03b2-actin (forward, 5\u2032-GCTACGTCGCCCTGGACTTC-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-GTCATAGTCCGCCTAGAAGC-3\u2032); NRIR (forward, 5\u2032-ATGGTTTTCTGGTGCCTTG-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-GGAGGTTAGAGGTGTCTGCTG-3\u2032); NRAV (forward, 5\u2032-TCACTACTGCCCCAGGATCA-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-GGTGGTCACAGGACTCATGG-3\u2032).\n\nFor detection of miR-130a, cDNA was synthesized using the TaqMan microRNA reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with a specific primer in gene-specific TaqMan assay kit (000454, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). MiR-130a level was determined using the gene-specific TaqMan assay kit (000454, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). U6 (001973, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used as an endogenous control (23) . Because the pre-mRNA levels can represent the initial transcription rate (24) , the primers used to detect the pre-mRNA of IFITM3 were designed targeting the intron of IFITM3 as previously described (25) . IFITM3 has two exons and one intron. For qPCR of IFITM3 pre-mRNA, the forward primers were positioned in the intron, and the reverse primer was positioned at the beginning of the second exon. For qPCR of IFITM3 mRNA, the forward primers were positioned in the first exon, and the reverse primer was positioned at the beginning of the second exon (24) . Because the basal expression of IFITM3 is low in A549 cells, we detected IFITM3 mRNA and pre-mRNA in A549 cells following IFN-\u03b12a treatment (20 IU/ml for 12 h) after the overexpression of NRIR.\n\nCell lysates were prepared using Radio Immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Equal amounts of protein (20 \u03bcg protein/lane) were electrophoresed on a 10%-SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in Trisbuffered saline at room temperature for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with antibodies against IFITM1 (Proteintech Group Cat# 60074-1-Ig Lot# RRID:AB_2233405), IFITM2, IFITM3 (Proteintech Group Cat# 66081-1-Ig Lot# RRID:AB_11182821), and \u03b2-actin (Proteintech, Wuhan, Hubei, China) or HTNV NP (provided by the Department of Microbiology, The Fourth Military Medical University) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The membranes were then washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and visualized using X-ray film. The blot densities were analyzed using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). In addition, the RIPA buffer contains 50mM Tris (pH = 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS. Protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was added before use.\n\nThe cells were cultured on glass coverslips (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) until they were semi-confluence and then incubated with HTNV for 60 min (moi = 1). At the indicated times post-HTNV infection, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA, incubated with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h. Following incubation with a mouse monoclonal antibody against c-myc-tag (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, Sigma-Aldrich Cat# M5546), IFITM3, lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), or HTNV NP at 37\u00b0C for 2 h, the cells were washed and incubated with anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to Alexa 555 and anti-mouse Ig conjugated to Alexa 488 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. An Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope system and FV1000 confocal microscopy system (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) were used to capture the images. hTnV binding and entry assay Cells transduced with IFITM3 or the empty vector were detached and washed extensively with cold PBS. The cells and HTNV were pre-chilled on ice for 30 min, mixed at a moi of 1 and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h with rotation. Part of cells were washed extensively with ice-cold PBS and harvested for binding assay. Another part of cells were switched to 37\u00b0C for 2 h to allow HTNV entry. The HTNV that remained on the cell surface was removed by treatment with proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). To achieve direct entry of HTNV into cells by virus-plasma membrane fusion as a positive control, cells were pre-chilled on ice for 10 min with 20 mM NH4Cl. Adsorption of HTNV (moi = 1) was performed at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. The cells were then washed, and fusion of the virus with the plasma membrane was triggered by incubation in low pH medium (20 mM sodium succinate, pH = 5.5) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. Infection was followed by incubation for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 20 mM NH4Cl (26) . qPCR analysis of the HTNV S segment was conducted to evaluate the influence of IFITMs on HTNV cell adhesion and HTNV entry.\n\nAll data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). For association analysis of the rs12252 allele and genotype, Fisher's exact test was used. Independent samples t-tests were used for normally distributed data. Differences among groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures, followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nThe iFiTM3 snP rs12252 c allele and cc genotype associated with severe hFrs Disease and a higher Plasma hTnV load\n\nTo determine the clinical significance of IFITM3 SNP in HTNV infection, the relationship between rs12252 SNP and the severity of HFRS in 69 patients were examined. We sequenced 300 bp of the IFITM3 locus encompassing SNP rs12252 in all enrolled patients. Then, we stratified these patients into mild and severe, based on the clinical assessment as described in Section \"Material and Methods. \" We found a significantly higher frequency of the C allele among severe HFRS patients compared with the healthy Han Chinese in the 1,000 genomes sequence database (68.29 vs. 52.16%, P = 0.0076). The frequency of rs12252 C in severe patients was also higher than those mild patients (68.29 vs. 46.43%, P = 0.013, Figures 1A,B; Table 2 ). These data suggest that harboring rs12252 C allele increases the risk of suffering severe disease in HTNV-infected individuals, with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.124 (1.067-4.230). For genotypes, 43.90% of the severe patients carried the CC genotype, a significantly higher frequency than the control Han Chinese per 1,000 genomes sequence database (26.92% CC genotype, P = 0.03) as well as mildly infected patients (14.29%, P = 0.02, Figures 1A,B ; Table 2 ). However, mildly ill individuals did not exhibit a Fisher's exact test was used to test the association between rs12252 allele/genotype and HFRS severity. (c) The plasma HTNV load in CC genotype patients and CT/TT genotype patients, tested by qRCR analysis. Each symbol represents one individual patient. Independent samples t-test was used to test the difference of HTNV load between groups. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. significantly different genotype frequencies compared with the Han Chinese population. In addition, we also found that patients with CC genotype had higher plasma viral load in acute phase ( Figure 1C) . These results support the notion that the normal function of IFITM3 plays a critical role in the immune response to HTNV infection in vivo, which has a substantial influence on the clinical manifestation of HFRS.\n\nPrevious studies reveal that the truncated IFITM3 protein produced by SNP rs12252 C allele (Figure 2A , the missing part stands for the truncated 21 amino acids from N-terminal of IFITM3, the intramembrane helix, and transmembrane helix was presented as boxes) leads to an impaired anti-influenza activity (14) . To test the functional significance of this polymorphism in HTNV infection, we transfected the majority T or minority C variant IFITM3 alleles that produce full-length or N-terminally truncated (N\u039421) proteins (Figure 2A ) with c-myc-tag to HUVEC and A549 cell using lentivirus vectors ( Figure 2B) . Then, we challenged the cells with HTNV at moi = 1 for 24 h and found that cells with the minority C variant were more susceptible to HTNV infection with higher expression of HTNV S segment ( Figure 2C ) and more positive of HTNV NP ( Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). Indeed, compared with the mock (empty vector)-infected control, the N\u039421 protein almost lost the ability to inhibit HTNV infection in both HUVEC and A549 cells (Figures 2C,D ; Figure S3 in Supplementary Material).\n\nTo determine the role of HTNV infection in inducing IFITMs, qPCR as well as Western blot of IFITMs were conducted in HUVEC and A549 cells (Figures 3A,B ; Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). While we observed only a moderate upregulation of IFITM1, 2, and 3 mRNA and protein in HUVECs after more than 24 h postinfection; IFITM1, 2, and 3 mRNA, however, were only transiently upregulated in A549 cells and caused no significant change in protein level.\n\nWe knocked down the IFITM1, 2, and 3 expression by transfection of their siRNAs individually. The effect of siRNAs on the expression of target IFITMs was tested by qPCR in HUVECs ( Figure S2 in Supplementary Material), and the effect of the best oligo against each IFITMs (IFITM1C, IFITM2A, IFITM3B) was tested by Western blot in A549 ( Figure 4A ) and HUVEC cells ( Figure 4B) . To assess the role of IFITMs in anti-HTNV effect of IFN-\u03b12a, IFITM1, 2, and 3 were knocked down respectively by transfecting the above-tested oligoes for 12 h, followed by IFN-\u03b12a treatment (20 IU/ml for another 12 h). The cells were then challenged with HTNV (moi = 1) for 24 h. The HTNV S segment and NP levels were significantly suppressed in both HUVEC and A549 cells in response to IFN-\u03b12a treatment.\n\nNotably, knockdown of IFITM3 significantly restored the levels of HTNV S segment and NP in HUVEC and A549 cells. Knockdown of IFITM1 also partially restored the HTNV level in A549 cells (Figures 4C,D) . These results demonstrate that \n\nTo assess the anti-HTNV effects of IFITMs, we tested the effect of overexpressed IFITM1, 2, and 3 on HTNV infection. c-myc-tagged IFITM1, 2, and 3 were expressed in both HUVEC and A549 cells (Figure 5A) , and the cells were then challenged with HTNV (moi = 1) for 24 h. The HTNV S segment and NP levels were suppressed by IFITM3 overexpression in HUVEC cells (Figures 5B-D) . They were also suppressed by expressing IFITM1 and IFITM3 in A549 cells (Figures 5B-D) .\n\nThe inhibitory effect of IFITM3 was further confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of HTNV NP ( Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). These results were in accordance with the above-described RNAi results. To determine whether IFITM3 inhibited HTNV binding or entry, HUVEC and A549 cells were incubated with HTNV (moi = 1) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, unbound virus was washed away, and HTNV RNA collected at this time point represents HTNV bound to the cell surface. After virus binding, the cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C for 2 h to allow HTNV internalization, and HTNV RNA collected at this time point represents cell-internalized virus. As a positive control for inhibition of virus entry, we incubated a parallel group of cells with HTNV at pH = 5.5 as described in Section \"Materials and Methods.\" Expression of IFITM3 did not affect HTNV binding ( Figure 6A ) but significantly suppressed HTNV entry in both HUVEC and A549 cells (Figure 6B ). iFiTM3 Was Partially localized to laMP1 + late endosomes in the host cells\n\nTo elucidate the mechanism of IFITM3 function, we investigated the subcellular localization of IFTIM3 in the host cells. IFITM3 was found partially localized to LAMP1 + late endosomes in HUVECs analyzed by confocal microscopy (Figure 6C) . The co-localization of IFITM3 and LAMP1 + late endosomes had also been found in A549 cells (27) . Because the transfer into LAMP1 + late endosomes is a necessary step for HTNV entry (28) , this result provides an evidence for the anti-HTNV mechanism of IFITM3.\n\nLncRNA-and microRNA-mediated regulation of IFITM3 has been reported in several studies. We tested the change of previously reported regulators of IFITMs, such as NRAV, NRIR, and miR-130a after HTNV infection, among which NRIR was the only changed one (downregulated) after HTNV infection ( Figure 7A ; Figure S4 in Supplementary Material) in HUVEC. However, the expression of NRIR was unchanged in A549 cells. We overexpressed NRIR in HUVEC and A549 cells using the pcDNA3.1 vector ( Figure 7B) . Importantly, overexpression of NRIR significantly suppressed IFITM3 mRNA and pre-mRNA levels and facilitated HTNV infection in HUVEC and A549 cells (Figures 7C-E) . These data suggest that lncRNA NRIR is a negative regulator of IFITM3 transcription.\n\nHantaan virus is an enveloped, negative-sense RNA virus from the genus Hantavirus within the family Bunyaviridae. It causes HFRS, which is an important threat to public health worldwide. It is also a potential weapon for biological terrorism. Reservoir animals, usually rodents, are asymptomatic during persistent infection. Unlike in rodents, Hantavirus infection leads to HFRS and Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans (21) . The major clinical characteristics of HFRS include fever, hemorrhage, hypotension, and renal injury (1, 21) , causing severe manifestations and death in some cases. The current standard of care for HFRS relies on symptomatic and supportive treatment. It has been confirmed that the plasma viral load is associated with the severity of HFRS, implicating the importance of viremia in the pathogenesis of HFRS (2). However, no direct antiviral medications are currently available for this illness. Interferon is the key molecule for the antiviral response and has been used as an antiviral medicine in many diseases. It has been reported that HTNV infection induces a late type I interferon response (16) . However, the set of ISGs required for IFN-mediated inhibition of HTNV has not yet been identified. Therefore, identification of ISGs that are effective against HTNV is an attractive strategy to identify novel therapeutic targets.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrated a significantly high frequency of the rs12252 C allele and CC genotype among HFRS patients with severe illness compared with mildly infected individuals and the healthy Han Chinese. The rs12252 C allele and CC genotype are also found to be associated with higher plasma viral load in the early stage of HFRS. We also discovered that HTNV infection induces IFITMs, and the truncated IFITM3 produced by rs12252 C allele exhibits significantly decreased anti-HTNV activity. Interestingly, IFITM3 is found to restrict HTNV infection with a mechanism of cellular entry inhibition. Indeed, IFITM3 is localized to the late endosome in the host cells, which is a necessary structure for HTNV entry. In addition, we find that HTNV infection downregulated lncRNA NRIR 48 h post infection, which negatively regulates the transcription of IFITM3. Collectively, these results suggest that IFITM3, regulated by NRIR, inhibits HTNV infection, and its SNP rs12252 correlates with the disease severity and viral load in patients with HFRS.\n\nThe antiviral properties of IFITM proteins were identified in 2009 in an RNAi screen for host factors that influence influenza virus replication (29) . IFITM1, 2, and 3 have been demonstrated to possess antiviral activity in several studies. Everitt et al. demonstrated that the severity of influenza virus infection was greatly increased in IFITM3-knockout mice compared with wild-type animals (15) . Different IFITM members have also been confirmed to inhibit the cellular entry of multiple virus families (including filoviruses, rhabdoviruses, and flaviviruses) (7, (9) (10) (11) 30) . For example, HIV-1 and HCV infection are inhibited by IFITM1 (31) (32) (33) (34) . It is commonly believed that IFITMs restrict viral infection at the stage of cellular entry (12) . Recent studies suggested that the cellular location of different IFITMs may influence the range of viruses restricted by each protein (5) . IFITM1 prevents HCV entry because it colocalizes with CD81 on the cell membrane, interrupting the endocytosis of HCV particles (32) , whereas IFITM3 confines influenza virus in acidified endosomal compartments (27) . Notably, retrovirus subvirus particles (ISVPs), which do not require endosomal acidification for entry, are not inhibited by IFITM3 expression, suggesting that IFITM3 may function at the stage of endosomal entry (35) . Studies utilizing cell-cell fusion assays have suggested that IFITM3 blocks the entry of enveloped virus by preventing the fusion of the viral membrane with a limiting membrane of the host cell, either the plasma membrane and/or the endosomal membranes. The results obtained using two-photon laser scanning and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) suggest that IFITM proteins may reduce membrane fluidity and increase the spontaneous positive curvature in the outer leaflet of membranes (36) . In the present study, we demonstrated that IFN-\u03b12a (20 U/ ml) significantly inhibited HTNV infection, siRNA-mediated depletion of IFITM3 alone significantly mitigated the antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b12a in both HUVEC and A549 cells, whereas depletion of IFITM1 alone alleviated the antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b12a in A549 cells. Overexpression of IFITM3 inhibited HTNV infection to HUVEC and A549 cells. IFITM1 overexpression was also effective in inhibition of HTNV in A549 cells. All these results suggest that IFITM3 is an important control factor under natural infection of HTNV. Our results also demonstrate that the effectiveness of IFITM3 is cell type-independent, which is in accordance with the results from similar viruses, such as RVFV (18) . Binding and entry assays, conducted by controlling the temperature and pH, showed that IFITM3 did not significantly influence HTNV binding but inhibited HTNV entry into HUVEC and A549 cells. Indeed, IFITM3 partially localizes to the late endosome of the host cells, which is a necessary site for the HTNV entry. However, we failed in tracking the transportation of HTNV in infected cells possibly due to the lack of fluorescence-labeled virus. In addition, IFITM1 also suppressed HTNV infection in A549 cells. The mechanism underlying anti-HTNV effect of IFITM1 remains undetermined and deserves to be further explored.\n\nAccording to a recent study on the three-dimensional structure of IFITM3, there is a C-terminal transmembrane \u03b1-helix and a two-N-terminal intramembrane \u03b1-helices (shown in Figure 2A as black boxes) in IFITM3 (14) . There are two splice variants that differ by the presence or absence of the first N-terminal 21 amino acids (deleted part, shown in Figure 2A as red dotted line). Several SNPs including 13 non-synonymous, 13 synonymous, 1 in-frame stop, and 1 splice site acceptoraltering have been reported in the translated IFITM3 sequence (15, 29) . Among them, the rare SNP rs12252C allele of IFITM3 truncates the protein as described above, leading to a reduced inhibition of influenza virus infection in A549 cells (15) . We demonstrated that truncated IFITM3 protein also loses the ability to inhibit HTNV infection in vitro. In Northern European patients hospitalized with seasonal influenza or pandemic influenza A virus, increased homozygosity of the minor C allele of SNP rs12252 in IFITM3 was observed (37) . In Chinese patients infected with influenza A (H1N1) virus, there was also an increased frequency of the C allele and CC genotype of SNP rs12252 (13) . In the present study, we observed an increased frequency of the C allele and CC genotype of SNP rs12252 in severely infected HFRS patients compared with healthy control and mildly affected patients. Patients carrying the CC genotype also had higher plasma viral loads compared with those with the CT/TT genotype. Given the impaired function of the IFITM3 protein produced by the C mutation, and the fact that enrichment of the rs12252 C allele in patients with severe disease and the higher viral load in patients with the CC genotype, this founding suggests that IFITM3 plays a pivotal role in the anti-HTNV response in vivo. We speculate that the much higher level of CC allele at healthy population of Han Chinese compared with Caucasians may place the Chinese at a higher risk for developing severe illness upon HTNV infection, which needs further investigation.\n\nLncRNAs are a group of non-coding RNAs longer than 200 nt that function as gene regulators, playing a role in regulating multiple cellular functions, including the innate immunity. For example, lncRNA NEAT1 is reported to be upregulated by influenza virus or PolyI:C stimulation, which promotes IL-8 expression (38) . lncRNA NRAV has been shown to negatively regulate the initial transcription of IFITM3 and Mx1 by affecting the histone modification of these genes (25) . lncRNA NRIR is a non-coding ISG, which has been reported to negatively regulate IFITM1 and Mx1 expression in HCV infection (20) . Mir-130a was also reported as a regulator of IFITM1 (23) . In this analysis, lncRNA NRIR was downregulated in HUVECs after HTNV infection for 48 h, overexpression of NRIR negatively regulates the initial transcription of IFITM3, evidenced by the decreased pre-mRNA as well as mRNA levels. NRIR overexpression also facilitated HTNV infection. These results indicate that the downregulation of NRIR after HTNV infection is possibly involved in the activation of innate immune responses against HTNV infection. We have also evaluated other potential regulators of IFITM3 before we choose NRIR for further study. Another lncRNA that can regulate IFITM3, i.e., NRAV (NR_038854), remained unchanged after HTNV infection ( Figures S4A,B in Supplementary Material). Additionally, miR-130a, which potentially regulate IFITM3, was also unaltered after HTNV infection ( Figures S4C,D in Supplementary Material).\n\nIn conclusion, this study revealed a critical role for IFITM3 in HTNV infection. We demonstrated, for the first time to our knowledge, that IFITM3 is a newly identified anti-HTNV ISG; its expression is negatively regulated by NRIR; and its antiviral activity seems via a mechanism of inhibiting virus entry into the host cells. In addition, we discovered that the IFITM3 SNP rs12252 C allele and CC genotype correlates with the plasma HTNV load and the severity of HFRS; and the rs12252 C allele produces a truncated IFITM3 protein (N\u039421) that attenuates its anti-HTNV function. These results provide new insights into the role of IFITM3 in regulating innate immunity against HTNV infection, which is the basis for identifying new targets to develop novel agent against this worldwide infectious disease. aUThOr cOnTribUTiOns ZX-y, BP-y, YC-t, and MH-w performed the experiments; WP-z, BX-f, LY-f, ZY, and JZ-s designed the research; HC-x, YW, and WX analyzed the data; TK

In response, many European countries have implemented\nunprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and\nuniversities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, widescale social\ndistancing including local and national Iockdowns.\n\nIn this report, we use a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model to attempt to infer the impact\nof these interventions across 11 European countries. Our methods assume that changes in the\nreproductive number\u2014 a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these interventions\nbeing implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. Our model estimates these\nchanges by calculating backwards from the deaths observed over time to estimate transmission that\noccurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death.\n\nOne of the key assumptions of the model is that each intervention has the same effect on the\nreproduction number across countries and over time. This allows us to leverage a greater amount of\ndata across Europe to estimate these effects. It also means that our results are driven strongly by the\ndata from countries with more advanced epidemics, and earlier interventions, such as Italy and Spain.\nWe find that the slowing growth in daily reported deaths in Italy is consistent with a significant impact\nof interventions implemented several weeks earlier. In Italy, we estimate that the effective\nreproduction number, Rt, dropped to close to 1 around the time of Iockdown (11th March), although\nwith a high level of uncertainty.\n\nOverall, we estimate that countries have managed to reduce their reproduction number. Our\nestimates have wide credible intervals and contain 1 for countries that have implemented a||\ninterventions considered in our analysis. This means that the reproduction number may be above or\nbelow this value. With current interventions remaining in place to at least the end of March, we\nestimate that interventions across all 11 countries will have averted 59,000 deaths up to 31 March\n[95% credible interval 21,000-120,000]. Many more deaths will be averted through ensuring that\ninterventions remain in place until transmission drops to low levels. We estimate that, across all 11\ncountries between 7 and 43 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-Z up to 28th March,\nrepresenting between 1.88% and 11.43% ofthe population. The proportion of the population infected\n\nto date \u2014 the attack rate - is estimated to be highest in Spain followed by Italy and lowest in Germany\nand Norway, reflecting the relative stages of the epidemics.\n\nGiven the lag of 2-3 weeks between when transmission changes occur and when their impact can be\nobserved in trends in mortality, for most of the countries considered here it remains too early to be\ncertain that recent interventions have been effective. If interventions in countries at earlier stages of\ntheir epidemic, such as Germany or the UK, are more or less effective than they were in the countries\nwith advanced epidemics, on which our estimates are largely based, or if interventions have improved\nor worsened over time, then our estimates of the reproduction number and deaths averted would\nchange accordingly. It is therefore critical that the current interventions remain in place and trends in\ncases and deaths are closely monitored in the coming days and weeks to provide reassurance that\ntransmission of SARS-Cov-Z is slowing.\n\nSUGGESTED CITATION\n\nSeth Flaxman, Swapnil Mishra, Axel Gandy et 0/. Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non\u2014\npharmaceutical interventions on COVID\u201419 in 11 European countries. Imperial College London (2020), doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.25561/77731\n\n1 Introduction\n\nFollowing the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-Z) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and\nits global spread, large epidemics of the disease, caused by the virus designated COVID-19, have\nemerged in Europe. In response to the rising numbers of cases and deaths, and to maintain the\ncapacity of health systems to treat as many severe cases as possible, European countries, like those in\nother continents, have implemented or are in the process of implementing measures to control their\nepidemics. These large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions vary between countries but include\nsocial distancing (such as banning large gatherings and advising individuals not to socialize outside\ntheir households), border closures, school closures, measures to isolate symptomatic individuals and\ntheir contacts, and large-scale lockdowns of populations with all but essential internal travel banned.\nUnderstanding firstly, whether these interventions are having the desired impact of controlling the\nepidemic and secondly, which interventions are necessary to maintain control, is critical given their\nlarge economic and social costs.\n\nThe key aim ofthese interventions is to reduce the effective reproduction number, Rt, ofthe infection,\na fundamental epidemiological quantity representing the average number of infections, at time t, per\ninfected case over the course of their infection. Ith is maintained at less than 1, the incidence of new\ninfections decreases, ultimately resulting in control of the epidemic. If Rt is greater than 1, then\ninfections will increase (dependent on how much greater than 1 the reproduction number is) until the\nepidemic peaks and eventually declines due to acquisition of herd immunity.\n\nIn China, strict movement restrictions and other measures including case isolation and quarantine\nbegan to be introduced from 23rd January, which achieved a downward trend in the number of\nconfirmed new cases during February, resulting in zero new confirmed indigenous cases in Wuhan by\nMarch 19th. Studies have estimated how Rt changed during this time in different areas ofChina from\naround 2-4 during the uncontrolled epidemic down to below 1, with an estimated 7-9 fold decrease\nin the number of daily contacts per person.1'2 Control measures such as social distancing, intensive\ntesting, and contact tracing in other countries such as Singapore and South Korea have successfully\nreduced case incidence in recent weeks, although there is a riskthe virus will spread again once control\nmeasures are relaxed.3'4\n\nThe epidemic began slightly laterin Europe, from January or later in different regions.5 Countries have\nimplemented different combinations of control measures and the level of adherence to government\nrecommendations on social distancing is likely to vary between countries, in part due to different\nlevels of enforcement.\n\nEstimating reproduction numbers for SARS-CoV-Z presents challenges due to the high proportion of\ninfections not detected by health systems\u201d7 and regular changes in testing policies, resulting in\ndifferent proportions of infections being detected over time and between countries. Most countries\nso far only have the capacity to test a small proportion of suspected cases and tests are reserved for\nseverely ill patients or for high-risk groups (e.g. contacts of cases). Looking at case data, therefore,\ngives a systematically biased view of trends.\n\nAn alternative way to estimate the course of the epidemic is to back-calculate infections from\nobserved deaths. Reported deaths are likely to be more reliable, although the early focus of most\nsurveillance systems on cases with reported travel histories to China may mean that some early deaths\nwill have been missed. Whilst the recent trends in deaths will therefore be informative, there is a time\nlag in observing the effect of interventions on deaths since there is a 2-3-week period between\ninfection, onset of symptoms and outcome.\n\nIn this report, we fit a novel Bayesian mechanistic model of the infection cycle to observed deaths in\n11 European countries, inferring plausible upper and lower bounds (Bayesian credible intervals) of the\ntotal populations infected (attack rates), case detection probabilities, and the reproduction number\nover time (Rt). We fit the model jointly to COVID-19 data from all these countries to assess whether\nthere is evidence that interventions have so far been successful at reducing Rt below 1, with the strong\nassumption that particular interventions are achieving a similar impact in different countries and that\nthe efficacy of those interventions remains constant over time. The model is informed more strongly\nby countries with larger numbers of deaths and which implemented interventions earlier, therefore\nestimates of recent Rt in countries with more recent interventions are contingent on similar\nintervention impacts. Data in the coming weeks will enable estimation of country-specific Rt with\ngreater precision.\n\nModel and data details are presented in the appendix, validation and sensitivity are also presented in\nthe appendix, and general limitations presented below in the conclusions.\n\n2 Results\n\nThe timing of interventions should be taken in the context of when an individual country\u2019s epidemic\nstarted to grow along with the speed with which control measures were implemented. Italy was the\nfirst to begin intervention measures, and other countries followed soon afterwards (Figure 1). Most\ninterventions began around 12th-14th March. We analyzed data on deaths up to 28th March, giving a\n2-3-week window over which to estimate the effect of interventions. Currently, most countries in our\nstudy have implemented all major non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\nFor each country, we model the number of infections, the number of deaths, and Rt, the effective\nreproduction number over time, with Rt changing only when an intervention is introduced (Figure 2-\n12). Rt is the average number of secondary infections per infected individual, assuming that the\ninterventions that are in place at time t stay in place throughout their entire infectious period. Every\ncountry has its own individual starting reproduction number Rt before interventions take place.\nSpecific interventions are assumed to have the same relative impact on Rt in each country when they\nwere introduced there and are informed by mortality data across all countries.\n\n\nFigure l: Intervention timings for the 11 European countries included in the analysis. For further\ndetails see Appendix 8.6.\n\n2.1 Estimated true numbers of infections and current attack rates\n\nIn all countries, we estimate there are orders of magnitude fewer infections detected (Figure 2) than\ntrue infections, mostly likely due to mild and asymptomatic infections as well as limited testing\ncapacity. In Italy, our results suggest that, cumulatively, 5.9 [1.9-15.2] million people have been\ninfected as of March 28th, giving an attack rate of 9.8% [3.2%-25%] of the population (Table 1). Spain\nhas recently seen a large increase in the number of deaths, and given its smaller population, our model\nestimates that a higher proportion of the population, 15.0% (7.0 [18-19] million people) have been\ninfected to date. Germany is estimated to have one of the lowest attack rates at 0.7% with 600,000\n[240,000-1,500,000] people infected.\n\nImperial College COVID-19 Response Team\n\nTable l: Posterior model estimates of percentage of total population infected as of 28th March 2020.\n\nCountry % of total population infected (mean [95% credible intervall)\nAustria 1.1% [0.36%-3.1%]\nBelgium 3.7% [1.3%-9.7%]\nDenmark 1.1% [0.40%-3.1%]\nFrance 3.0% [1.1%-7.4%]\nGermany 0.72% [0.28%-1.8%]\nItaly 9.8% [3.2%-26%]\nNorway 0.41% [0.09%-1.2%]\nSpain 15% [3.7%-41%]\nSweden 3.1% [0.85%-8.4%]\nSwitzerland 3.2% [1.3%-7.6%]\nUnited Kingdom 2.7% [1.2%-5.4%]\n\n2.2 Reproduction numbers and impact of interventions\n\nAveraged across all countries, we estimate initial reproduction numbers of around 3.87 [3.01-4.66],\nwhich is in line with other estimates.1'8 These estimates are informed by our choice of serial interval\ndistribution and the initial growth rate of observed deaths. A shorter assumed serial interval results in\nlower starting reproduction numbers (Appendix 8.4.2, Appendix 8.4.6). The initial reproduction\nnumbers are also uncertain due to (a) importation being the dominant source of new infections early\nin the epidemic, rather than local transmission (b) possible under-ascertainment in deaths particularly\nbefore testing became widespread.\n\nWe estimate large changes in Rt in response to the combined non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our\nresults, which are driven largely by countries with advanced epidemics and larger numbers of deaths\n(e.g. Italy, Spain), suggest that these interventions have together had a substantial impact on\ntransmission, as measured by changes in the estimated reproduction number Rt. Across all countries\nwe find current estimates of Rt to range from a posterior mean of 0.97 [0.14-2.14] for Norway to a\nposterior mean of2.64 [1.40-4.18] for Sweden, with an average of 1.43 across the 11 country posterior\nmeans, a 64% reduction compared to the pre-intervention values. We note that these estimates are\ncontingent on intervention impact being the same in different countries and at different times. In all\ncountries but Sweden, under the same assumptions, we estimate that the current reproduction\nnumber includes 1 in the uncertainty range. The estimated reproduction number for Sweden is higher,\nnot because the mortality trends are significantly different from any other country, but as an artefact\nof our model, which assumes a smaller reduction in Rt because no full lockdown has been ordered so\nfar. Overall, we cannot yet conclude whether current interventions are sufficient to drive Rt below 1\n(posterior probability of being less than 1.0 is 44% on average across the countries). We are also\nunable to conclude whether interventions may be different between countries or over time.\n\nThere remains a high level of uncertainty in these estimates. It is too early to detect substantial\nintervention impact in many countries at earlier stages of their epidemic (e.g. Germany, UK, Norway).\nMany interventions have occurred only recently, and their effects have not yet been fully observed\ndue to the time lag between infection and death. This uncertainty will reduce as more data become\navailable. For all countries, our model fits observed deaths data well (Bayesian goodness of fit tests).\nWe also found that our model can reliably forecast daily deaths 3 days into the future, by withholding\nthe latest 3 days of data and comparing model predictions to observed deaths (Appendix 8.3).\n\nThe close spacing of interventions in time made it statistically impossible to determine which had the\ngreatest effect (Figure 1, Figure 4). However, when doing a sensitivity analysis (Appendix 8.4.3) with\nuninformative prior distributions (where interventions can increase deaths) we find similar impact of\n\nImperial College COVID-19 Response Team\n\ninterventions, which shows that our choice of prior distribution is not driving the effects we see in the\n\nmain analysis.\n\n\nFigure 2: Country-level estimates of infections, deaths and Rt. Left: daily number of infections, brown\nbars are reported infections, blue bands are predicted infections, dark blue 50% credible interval (CI),\nlight blue 95% CI. The number of daily infections estimated by our model drops immediately after an\nintervention, as we assume that all infected people become immediately less infectious through the\nintervention. Afterwards, if the Rt is above 1, the number of infections will starts growing again.\nMiddle: daily number of deaths, brown bars are reported deaths, blue bands are predicted deaths, CI\nas in left plot.

Numbers in brackets are 95% credible intervals.\n \n\n2.3 Estimated impact of interventions on deaths\n\nTable 2 shows total forecasted deaths since the beginning of the epidemic up to and including 31\nMarch under ourfitted model and under the counterfactual model, which predicts what would have\nhappened if no interventions were implemented (and R, = R0 i.e. the initial reproduction number\nestimated before interventions). Again, the assumption in these predictions is that intervention\nimpact is the same across countries and time. The model without interventions was unable to capture\nrecent trends in deaths in several countries, where the rate of increase had clearly slowed (Figure 3).\nTrends were confirmed statistically by Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation and the widely\napplicable information criterion assessments \u2014WA|C).\n\nBy comparing the deaths predicted under the model with no interventions to the deaths predicted in\nour intervention model, we calculated the total deaths averted up to the end of March. We find that,\nacross 11 countries, since the beginning of the epidemic, 59,000 [21,000-120,000] deaths have been\naverted due to interventions. In Italy and Spain, where the epidemic is advanced, 38,000 [13,000-\n84,000] and 16,000 [5,400-35,000] deaths have been averted, respectively. Even in the UK, which is\nmuch earlier in its epidemic, we predict 370 [73-1,000] deaths have been averted.\n\nThese numbers give only the deaths averted that would have occurred up to 31 March. lfwe were to\ninclude the deaths of currently infected individuals in both models, which might happen after 31\nMarch, then the deaths averted would be substantially higher.\n\n\nFigure 3: Daily number of confirmed deaths, predictions (up to 28 March) and forecasts (after) for (a)\nItaly and (b) Spain from our model with interventions (blue) and from the no interventions\ncounterfactual model (pink); credible intervals are shown one week into the future.

Mean relative percentage reduction in Rt is shown\nwith 95% posterior credible intervals. If 100% reduction is achieved, Rt = 0 and there is no more\ntransmission of COVID-19. No effects are significantly different from any others, probably due to the\nfact that many interventions occurred on the same day or within days of each other as shown in\nFigure l.\n\n3 Discussion\n\nDuring this early phase of control measures against the novel coronavirus in Europe, we analyze trends\nin numbers of deaths to assess the extent to which transmission is being reduced. Representing the\nCOVlD-19 infection process using a semi-mechanistic, joint, Bayesian hierarchical model, we can\nreproduce trends observed in the data on deaths and can forecast accurately over short time horizons.\n\nWe estimate that there have been many more infections than are currently reported. The high level\nof under-ascertainment of infections that we estimate here is likely due to the focus on testing in\nhospital settings rather than in the community. Despite this, only a small minority of individuals in\neach country have been infected, with an attack rate on average of 4.9% [l.9%-ll%] with considerable\nvariation between countries (Table 1). Our estimates imply that the populations in Europe are not\nclose to herd immunity (\"50-75% if R0 is 2-4). Further, with Rt values dropping substantially, the rate\nof acquisition of herd immunity will slow down rapidly. This implies that the virus will be able to spread\nrapidly should interventions be lifted. Such estimates of the attack rate to date urgently need to be\nvalidated by newly developed antibody tests in representative population surveys, once these become\navailable.\n\nWe estimate that major non-pharmaceutical interventions have had a substantial impact on the time-\nvarying reproduction numbers in countries where there has been time to observe intervention effects\non trends in deaths (Italy, Spain). lfadherence in those countries has changed since that initial period,\nthen our forecast of future deaths will be affected accordingly: increasing adherence over time will\nhave resulted in fewer deaths and decreasing adherence in more deaths. Similarly, our estimates of\nthe impact ofinterventions in other countries should be viewed with caution if the same interventions\nhave achieved different levels of adherence than was initially the case in Italy and Spain.\n\nDue to the implementation of interventions in rapid succession in many countries, there are not\nenough data to estimate the individual effect size of each intervention, and we discourage attributing\n\nassociations to individual intervention. In some cases, such as Norway, where all interventions were\nimplemented at once, these individual effects are by definition unidentifiable. Despite this, while\nindividual impacts cannot be determined, their estimated joint impact is strongly empirically justified\n(see Appendix 8.4 for sensitivity analysis). While the growth in daily deaths has decreased, due to the\nlag between infections and deaths, continued rises in daily deaths are to be expected for some time.\n\nTo understand the impact of interventions, we fit a counterfactual model without the interventions\nand compare this to the actual model. Consider Italy and the UK - two countries at very different stages\nin their epidemics. For the UK, where interventions are very recent, much of the intervention strength\nis borrowed from countries with older epidemics. The results suggest that interventions will have a\nlarge impact on infections and deaths despite counts of both rising. For Italy, where far more time has\npassed since the interventions have been implemented, it is clear that the model without\ninterventions does not fit well to the data, and cannot explain the sub-linear (on the logarithmic scale)\nreduction in deaths (see Figure 10).\n\nThe counterfactual model for Italy suggests that despite mounting pressure on health systems,\ninterventions have averted a health care catastrophe where the number of new deaths would have\nbeen 3.7 times higher (38,000 deaths averted) than currently observed. Even in the UK, much earlier\nin its epidemic, the recent interventions are forecasted to avert 370 total deaths up to 31 of March.\n\n4 Conclusion and Limitations\n\nModern understanding of infectious disease with a global publicized response has meant that\nnationwide interventions could be implemented with widespread adherence and support. Given\nobserved infection fatality ratios and the epidemiology of COVlD-19, major non-pharmaceutical\ninterventions have had a substantial impact in reducing transmission in countries with more advanced\nepidemics. It is too early to be sure whether similar reductions will be seen in countries at earlier\nstages of their epidemic. While we cannot determine which set of interventions have been most\nsuccessful, taken together, we can already see changes in the trends of new deaths. When forecasting\n3 days and looking over the whole epidemic the number of deaths averted is substantial. We note that\nsubstantial innovation is taking place, and new more effective interventions or refinements of current\ninterventions, alongside behavioral changes will further contribute to reductions in infections. We\ncannot say for certain that the current measures have controlled the epidemic in Europe; however, if\ncurrent trends continue, there is reason for optimism.\n\nOur approach is semi-mechanistic. We propose a plausible structure for the infection process and then\nestimate parameters empirically. However, many parameters had to be given strong prior\ndistributions or had to be fixed. For these assumptions, we have provided relevant citations to\nprevious studies. As more data become available and better estimates arise, we will update these in\nweekly reports. Our choice of serial interval distribution strongly influences the prior distribution for\nstarting R0. Our infection fatality ratio, and infection-to-onset-to-death distributions strongly\ninfluence the rate of death and hence the estimated number of true underlying cases.\n\nWe also assume that the effect of interventions is the same in all countries, which may not be fully\nrealistic. This assumption implies that countries with early interventions and more deaths since these\ninterventions (e.g. Italy, Spain) strongly influence estimates of intervention impact in countries at\nearlier stages of their epidemic with fewer deaths (e.g. Germany, UK).\n\nWe have tried to create consistent definitions of all interventions and document details of this in\nAppendix 8.6. However, invariably there will be differences from country to country in the strength of\ntheir intervention \u2014 for example, most countries have banned gatherings of more than 2 people when\nimplementing a lockdown, whereas in Sweden the government only banned gatherings of more than\n10 people. These differences can skew impacts in countries with very little data. We believe that our\nuncertainty to some degree can cover these differences, and as more data become available,\ncoefficients should become more reliable.\n\nHowever, despite these strong assumptions, there is sufficient signal in the data to estimate changes\nin R, (see the sensitivity analysis reported in Appendix 8.4.3) and this signal will stand to increase with\ntime. In our Bayesian hierarchical framework, we robustly quantify the uncertainty in our parameter\nestimates and posterior predictions. This can be seen in the very wide credible intervals in more recent\ndays, where little or no death data are available to inform the estimates. Furthermore, we predict\nintervention impact at country-level, but different trends may be in place in different parts of each\ncountry. For example, the epidemic in northern Italy was subject to controls earlier than the rest of\nthe country.\n\n5 Data\n\nOur model utilizes daily real-time death data from the ECDC (European Centre of Disease Control),\nwhere we catalogue case data for 11 European countries currently experiencing the epidemic: Austria,\nBelgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United\nKingdom. The ECDC provides information on confirmed cases and deaths attributable to COVID-19.\nHowever, the case data are highly unrepresentative of the incidence of infections due to\nunderreporting as well as systematic and country-specific changes in testing.\n\nWe, therefore, use only deaths attributable to COVID-19 in our model; we do not use the ECDC case\nestimates at all. While the observed deaths still have some degree of unreliability, again due to\nchanges in reporting and testing, we believe the data are ofsufficient fidelity to model. For population\ncounts, we use UNPOP age-stratified counts.10\n\nWe also catalogue data on the nature and type of major non-pharmaceutical interventions. We looked\nat the government webpages from each country as well as their official public health\ndivision/information webpages to identify the latest advice/laws being issued by the government and\npublic health authorities. We collected the following:\n\nSchool closure ordered: This intervention refers to nationwide extraordinary school closures which in\nmost cases refer to both primary and secondary schools closing (for most countries this also includes\nthe closure of otherforms of higher education or the advice to teach remotely). In the case of Denmark\nand Sweden, we allowed partial school closures of only secondary schools. The date of the school\nclosure is taken to be the effective date when the schools started to be closed (ifthis was on a Monday,\nthe date used was the one of the previous Saturdays as pupils and students effectively stayed at home\nfrom that date onwards).\n\nCase-based measures: This intervention comprises strong recommendations or laws to the general\npublic and primary care about self\u2014isolation when showing COVID-19-like symptoms. These also\ninclude nationwide testing programs where individuals can be tested and subsequently self\u2014isolated.\nOur definition is restricted to nationwide government advice to all individuals (e.g. UK) or to all primary\ncare and excludes regional only advice. These do not include containment phase interventions such\nas isolation if travelling back from an epidemic country such as China.\n\nPublic events banned: This refers to banning all public events of more than 100 participants such as\nsports events.\n\nSocial distancing encouraged: As one of the first interventions against the spread of the COVID-19\npandemic, many governments have published advice on social distancing including the\nrecommendation to work from home wherever possible, reducing use ofpublictransport and all other\nnon-essential contact. The dates used are those when social distancing has officially been\nrecommended by the government; the advice may include maintaining a recommended physical\ndistance from others.\n\nLockdown decreed: There are several different scenarios that the media refers to as lockdown. As an\noverall definition, we consider regulations/legislations regarding strict face-to-face social interaction:\nincluding the banning of any non-essential public gatherings, closure of educational and\n\npublic/cultural institutions, ordering people to stay home apart from exercise and essential tasks. We\ninclude special cases where these are not explicitly mentioned on government websites but are\nenforced by the police (e.g. France). The dates used are the effective dates when these legislations\nhave been implemented. We note that lockdown encompasses other interventions previously\nimplemented.\n\nFirst intervention: As Figure 1 shows, European governments have escalated interventions rapidly,\nand in some examples (Norway/Denmark) have implemented these interventions all on a single day.\nTherefore, given the temporal autocorrelation inherent in government intervention, we include a\nbinary covariate for the first intervention, which can be interpreted as a government decision to take\nmajor action to control COVID-19.\n\nA full list of the timing of these interventions and the sources we have used can be found in Appendix\n8.6.\n\n6 Methods Summary\n\nA Visual summary of our model is presented in Figure 5 (details in Appendix 8.1 and 8.2). Replication\ncode is available at https://github.com/|mperia|CollegeLondon/covid19model/releases/tag/vl.0\n\nWe fit our model to observed deaths according to ECDC data from 11 European countries. The\nmodelled deaths are informed by an infection-to-onset distribution (time from infection to the onset\nof symptoms), an onset-to-death distribution (time from the onset of symptoms to death), and the\npopulation-averaged infection fatality ratio (adjusted for the age structure and contact patterns of\neach country, see Appendix). Given these distributions and ratios, modelled deaths are a function of\nthe number of infections. The modelled number of infections is informed by the serial interval\ndistribution (the average time from infection of one person to the time at which they infect another)\nand the time-varying reproduction number. Finally, the time-varying reproduction number is a\nfunction of the initial reproduction number before interventions and the effect sizes from\ninterventions. \n\n\nFigure 5: Summary of model components.\n\nFollowing the hierarchy from bottom to top gives us a full framework to see how interventions affect\ninfections, which can result in deaths. We use Bayesian inference to ensure our modelled deaths can\nreproduce the observed deaths as closely as possible. From bottom to top in Figure 5, there is an\nimplicit lag in time that means the effect of very recent interventions manifest weakly in current\ndeaths (and get stronger as time progresses). To maximise the ability to observe intervention impact\non deaths, we fit our model jointly for all 11 European countries, which results in a large data set. Our\nmodel jointly estimates the effect sizes of interventions. We have evaluated the effect ofour Bayesian\nprior distribution choices and evaluate our Bayesian posterior calibration to ensure our results are\nstatistically robust (Appendix 8.4).\n\n7 Acknowledgements\n\nInitial research on covariates in Appendix 8.6 was crowdsourced; we thank a number of people\nacross the world for help with this.

These daily deaths are\nmodelled using a positive real-Valued function dam = E(Dam) that represents the expected number\nof deaths attributed to COVID-19. Dam is assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution with\n\n\nThe expected number of deaths (1 in a given country on a given day is a function of the number of\ninfections C occurring in previous days.\n\nAt the beginning of the epidemic, the observed deaths in a country can be dominated by deaths that\nresult from infection that are not locally acquired. To avoid biasing our model by this, we only include\nobserved deaths from the day after a country has cumulatively observed 10 deaths in our model.\n\nTo mechanistically link ourfunction for deaths to infected cases, we use a previously estimated COVID-\n19 infection-fatality-ratio ifr (probability of death given infection)9 together with a distribution oftimes\nfrom infection to death TE. The ifr is derived from estimates presented in Verity et al11 which assumed\nhomogeneous attack rates across age-groups. To better match estimates of attack rates by age\ngenerated using more detailed information on country and age-specific mixing patterns, we scale\nthese estimates (the unadjusted ifr, referred to here as ifr\u2019) in the following way as in previous work.4\nLet Ca be the number of infections generated in age-group a, Na the underlying size of the population\nin that age group and AR\u201c 2 Ca/Na the age-group-specific attack rate. The adjusted ifr is then given\n\nby: ifra = \ufb01fi\ufb01\u00e9, where AR50_59 is the predicted attack-rate in the 50-59 year age-group after\n\nincorporating country-specific patterns of contact and mixing. This age-group was chosen as the\nreference as it had the lowest predicted level of underreporting in previous analyses of data from the\nChinese epidemic\u201c. We obtained country-specific estimates of attack rate by age, AR\u201c, for the 11\nEuropean countries in our analysis from a previous study which incorporates information on contact\nbetween individuals of different ages in countries across Europe.12 We then obtained overall ifr\nestimates for each country adjusting for both demography and age-specific attack rates.\n\nUsing estimated epidemiological information from previous studies,\u201c'11 we assume TE to be the sum of\ntwo independent random times: the incubation period (infection to onset of symptoms or infection-\nto-onset) distribution and the time between onset of symptoms and death (onset-to-death). The\ninfection-to-onset distribution is Gamma distributed with mean 5.1 days and coefficient of variation\n0.86. The onset-to-death distribution is also Gamma distributed with a mean of 18.8 days and a\ncoefficient of va riation 0.45. ifrm is population averaged over the age structure of a given country. The\ninfection-to-death distribution is therefore given by:\n\num ~ ifrm ~ (Gamma(5.1,0.86) + Gamma(18.8,0.45))\n\nFigure 6 shows the infection-to-death distribution and the resulting survival function that integrates\nto the infection fatality ratio.\n\n\nFigure 6: Left, infection-to-death distribution (mean 23.9 days). Right, survival probability of infected\nindividuals per day given the infection fatality ratio (1%) and the infection-to-death distribution on\nthe left.\n\nUsing the probability of death distribution, the expected number of deaths dam, on a given day t, for\ncountry, m, is given by the following discrete sum:\n\n\nThe number of deaths today is the sum of the past infections weighted by their probability of death,\nwhere the probability of death depends on the number of days since infection.\n\n8.2 Infection model\n\nThe true number of infected individuals, C, is modelled using a discrete renewal process. This approach\nhas been used in numerous previous studies13'16 and has a strong theoretical basis in stochastic\nindividual-based counting processes such as Hawkes process and the Bellman-Harris process.\u201d18 The\nrenewal model is related to the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, except the renewal is not\nexpressed in differential form. To model the number ofinfections over time we need to specify a serial\ninterval distribution g with density g(T), (the time between when a person gets infected and when\nthey subsequently infect another other people), which we choose to be Gamma distributed:\n\ng ~ Gamma (6.50.62).\n\nThe serial interval distribution is shown below in Figure 7 and is assumed to be the same for all\ncountries.\n\n \n\nFigure 7: Serial interval distribution g with a mean of 6.5 days.\n\nGiven the serial interval distribution, the number of infections Eamon a given day t, and country, m,\nis given by the following discrete convolution function:\n\n_ t\u20141\nCam \u2014 Ram ZT=0 Cr,mgt\u2014\u2018r r\nwhere, similarto the probability ofdeath function, the daily serial interval is discretized by\n\nfs+0.5\n\n1.5\ngs = T=s\u20140.Sg(T)dT fors = 2,3, and 91 = fT=Og(T)dT.\n\nInfections today depend on the number of infections in the previous days, weighted by the discretized\nserial interval distribution. This weighting is then scaled by the country-specific time-Varying\nreproduction number, Ram, that models the average number of secondary infections at a given time.\n\nThe functional form for the time-Varying reproduction number was chosen to be as simple as possible\nto minimize the impact of strong prior assumptions: we use a piecewise constant function that scales\nRam from a baseline prior R0,m and is driven by known major non-pharmaceutical interventions\noccurring in different countries and times. We included 6 interventions, one of which is constructed\nfrom the other 5 interventions, which are timings of school and university closures (k=l), self\u2014isolating\nif ill (k=2), banning of public events (k=3), any government intervention in place (k=4), implementing\na partial or complete lockdown (k=5) and encouraging social distancing and isolation (k=6). We denote\nthe indicator variable for intervention k E 1,2,3,4,5,6 by IkI\u2019m, which is 1 if intervention k is in place\nin country m at time t and 0 otherwise. The covariate \u201dany government intervention\u201d (k=4) indicates\nif any of the other 5 interventions are in effect,i.e.14\u2019t\u2019m equals 1 at time t if any of the interventions\nk E 1,2,3,4,5 are in effect in country m at time t and equals 0 otherwise. Covariate 4 has the\ninterpretation of indicating the onset of major government intervention. The effect of each\nintervention is assumed to be multiplicative. Ram is therefore a function ofthe intervention indicators\nIk\u2019t\u2019m in place at time t in country m:\n\nRam : R0,m eXp(\u2014 212:1 O(Rheum)-\n\nThe exponential form was used to ensure positivity of the reproduction number, with R0,m\nconstrained to be positive as it appears outside the exponential. The impact of each intervention on\n\nRam is characterised by a set of parameters 0(1, ...,OL6, with independent prior distributions chosen\nto be\n\nock ~ Gamma(. 5,1).\n\nThe impacts ock are shared between all m countries and therefore they are informed by all available\ndata. The prior distribution for R0 was chosen to be\n\nR0,m ~ Normal(2.4, IKI) with K ~ Normal(0,0.5),\nOnce again, K is the same among all countries to share information.\n\nWe assume that seeding of new infections begins 30 days before the day after a country has\ncumulatively observed 10 deaths. From this date, we seed our model with 6 sequential days of\ninfections drawn from cl\u2019m,...,66\u2019m~EXponential(T), where T~Exponential(0.03). These seed\ninfections are inferred in our Bayesian posterior distribution.\n\nWe estimated parameters jointly for all 11 countries in a single hierarchical model. Fitting was done\nin the probabilistic programming language Stan,19 using an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)\nsampler. We ran 8 chains for 4000 iterations with 2000 iterations of warmup and a thinning factor 4\nto obtain 2000 posterior samples. Posterior convergence was assessed using the Rhat statistic and by\ndiagnosing divergent transitions of the HMC sampler. Prior-posterior calibrations were also performed\n(see below).\n\n8.3 Validation\n\nWe validate accuracy of point estimates of our model using cross-Validation. In our cross-validation\nscheme, we leave out 3 days of known death data (non-cumulative) and fit our model. We forecast\nwhat the model predicts for these three days. We present the individual forecasts for each day, as\nwell as the average forecast for those three days. The cross-validation results are shown in the Figure\n8.\n\n\nFigure 8: Cross-Validation results for 3-day and 3-day aggregatedforecasts\n\nFigure 8 provides strong empirical justification for our model specification and mechanism. Our\naccurate forecast over a three-day time horizon suggests that our fitted estimates for Rt are\nappropriate and plausible.\n\nAlong with from point estimates we all evaluate our posterior credible intervals using the Rhat\nstatistic. The Rhat statistic measures whether our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains have\n\nconverged to the equilibrium distribution (the correct posterior distribution). Figure 9 shows the Rhat\nstatistics for all of our parameters\n\n\nFigure 9: Rhat statistics - values close to 1 indicate MCMC convergence.\n\nFigure 9 indicates that our MCMC have converged. In fitting we also ensured that the MCMC sampler\nexperienced no divergent transitions - suggesting non pathological posterior topologies.\n\n8.4 SensitivityAnalysis\n\n8.4.1 Forecasting on log-linear scale to assess signal in the data\n\nAs we have highlighted throughout in this report, the lag between deaths and infections means that\nit ta kes time for information to propagate backwa rds from deaths to infections, and ultimately to Rt.\nA conclusion of this report is the prediction of a slowing of Rt in response to major interventions. To\ngain intuition that this is data driven and not simply a consequence of highly constrained model\nassumptions, we show death forecasts on a log-linear scale. On this scale a line which curves below a\nlinear trend is indicative of slowing in the growth of the epidemic. Figure 10 to Figure 12 show these\nforecasts for Italy, Spain and the UK. They show this slowing down in the daily number of deaths. Our\nmodel suggests that Italy, a country that has the highest death toll of COVID-19, will see a slowing in\nthe increase in daily deaths over the coming week compared to the early stages of the epidemic.\n\n\nWe investigated the sensitivity of our estimates of starting and final Rt to our assumed serial interval\ndistribution. For this we considered several scenarios, in which we changed the serial interval\ndistribution mean, from a value of 6.5 days, to have values of 5, 6, 7 and 8 days.\n\nIn Figure 13, we show our estimates of R0, the starting reproduction number before interventions, for\neach of these scenarios. The relative ordering of the Rt=0 in the countries is consistent in all settings.\nHowever, as expected, the scale of Rt=0 is considerably affected by this change \u2014 a longer serial\ninterval results in a higher estimated Rt=0. This is because to reach the currently observed size of the\nepidemics, a longer assumed serial interval is compensated by a higher estimated R0.\n\nAdditionally, in Figure 14, we show our estimates of Rt at the most recent model time point, again for\neach ofthese scenarios. The serial interval mean can influence Rt substantially, however, the posterior\ncredible intervals of Rt are broadly overlapping.\n\n\nFigure 13: Initial reproduction number R0 for different serial interval (SI) distributions (means\nbetween 5 and 8 days). We use 6.5 days in our main analysis.\n\n\nFigure 14: Rt on 28 March 2020 estimated for all countries, with serial interval (SI) distribution means\nbetween 5 and 8 days. We use 6.5 days in our main analysis.\n\n8.4.3 Uninformative prior sensitivity on or\n\nWe ran our model using implausible uninformative prior distributions on the intervention effects,\nallowing the effect of an intervention to increase or decrease Rt. To avoid collinearity, we ran 6\nseparate models, with effects summarized below (compare with the main analysis in Figure 4). In this\nseries of univariate analyses, we find (Figure 15) that all effects on their own serve to decrease Rt.\nThis gives us confidence that our choice of prior distribution is not driving the effects we see in the\nmain analysis. Lockdown has a very large effect, most likely due to the fact that it occurs after other\ninterventions in our dataset. The relatively large effect sizes for the other interventions are most likely\ndue to the coincidence of the interventions in time, such that one intervention is a proxy for a few\nothers.\n\n\nFigure 15: Effects of different interventions when used as the only covariate in the model.\n\n8.4.4\n\nTo assess prior assumptions on our piecewise constant functional form for Rt we test using a\nnonparametric function with a Gaussian process prior distribution. We fit a model with a Gaussian\nprocess prior distribution to data from Italy where there is the largest signal in death data. We find\nthat the Gaussian process has a very similartrend to the piecewise constant model and reverts to the\nmean in regions of no data. The correspondence of a completely nonparametric function and our\npiecewise constant function suggests a suitable parametric specification of Rt.\n\nNonparametric fitting of Rf using a Gaussian process:\n\n8.4.5 Leave country out analysis\n\nDue to the different lengths of each European countries\u2019 epidemic, some countries, such as Italy have\nmuch more data than others (such as the UK). To ensure that we are not leveraging too much\ninformation from any one country we perform a \u201dleave one country out\u201d sensitivity analysis, where\nwe rerun the model without a different country each time. Figure 16 and Figure 17 are examples for\nresults for the UK, leaving out Italy and Spain. In general, for all countries, we observed no significant\ndependence on any one country.\n\nFigure 16: Model results for the UK, when not using data from Italy for fitting the model. See the\n\n\nFigure 17: Model results for the UK, when not using data from Spain for fitting the model. See caption\nof Figure 2 for an explanation of the plots.\n\n8.4.6 Starting reproduction numbers vs theoretical predictions\n\nTo validate our starting reproduction numbers, we compare our fitted values to those theoretically\nexpected from a simpler model assuming exponential growth rate, and a serial interval distribution\nmean. We fit a linear model with a Poisson likelihood and log link function and extracting the daily\ngrowth rate r. For well-known theoretical results from the renewal equation, given a serial interval\ndistribution g(r) with mean m and standard deviation 5, given a = mZ/S2 and b = m/SZ, and\n\na\nsubsequently R0 = (1 + %) .Figure 18 shows theoretically derived R0 along with our fitted\n\nestimates of Rt=0 from our Bayesian hierarchical model. As shown in Figure 18 there is large\ncorrespondence between our estimated starting reproduction number and the basic reproduction\nnumber implied by the growth rate r.\n\nR0 (red) vs R(FO) (black)\n\nFigure 18: Our estimated R0 (black) versus theoretically derived Ru(red) from a log-linear\nregression fit.\n\n8.5 Counterfactual analysis \u2014 interventions vs no interventions\n\n\nFigure 19: Daily number of confirmed deaths, predictions (up to 28 March) and forecasts (after) for\nall countries except Italy and Spain from our model with interventions (blue) and from the no\ninterventions counterfactual model (pink); credible intervals are shown one week into the future.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.25561/77731\n\nPage 28 of 35\n\n30 March 2020 Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team\n\n8.6 Data sources and Timeline of Interventions\n\nFigure 1 and Table 3 display the interventions by the 11 countries in our study and the dates these\ninterventions became effective.\n\nTable 3: Timeline of Interventions.\n \n\nCountry Type Event Date effective\nSchool closure\nordered Nationwide school closures.20 14/3/2020\nPublic events\nbanned Banning of gatherings of more than 5 people.21 10/3/2020\nBanning all access to public spaces and gatherings\nLockdown of more than 5 people.

The unclear comprehension and negative attitudes towards the emerging infectious disease among general population may lead to unnecessary worry and even panic. The objective of this study was to investigate the Chinese public response to H1N1 pandemic and provide baseline data to develop public education campaigns in response to future outbreaks. METHODS: A close-ended questionnaire developed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention was applied to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 among 10,669 responders recruited from seven urban and two rural areas of China sampled by using the probability proportional to size (PPS) method. RESULTS: 30.0% respondents were not clear whether food spread H1N1 virusand. 65.7% reported that the pandemic had no impact on their life. The immunization rates of the seasonal flu and H1N1vaccine were 7.5% and 10.8%, respectively. Farmers and those with lower education level were less likely to know the main transmission route (cough or talk face to face). Female and those with college and above education had higher perception of risk and more compliance with preventive behaviors. Relationships between knowledge and risk perception (OR = 1.69; 95%CI 1.54-1.86), and knowledge and practices (OR = 1.57; 95%CI 1.42-1.73) were found among the study subjects. With regard to the behavior of taking up A/H1N1 vaccination, there are several related factors found in the current study population, including the perception of life disturbed (OR = 1.29; 95%CI 1.11-1.50), the safety of A/H1N1 vaccine (OR = 0.07; 95%CI 0.04-0.11), the knowledge of free vaccination policy (OR = 7.20; 95%CI 5.91-8.78), the state's priority vaccination strategy(OR = 1.33; 95%CI 1.08-1.64), and taking up seasonal influenza vaccine behavior (OR = 4.69; 95%CI 3.53-6.23). CONCLUSIONS: This A/H1N1 epidemic has not caused public panic yet, but the knowledge of A/H1N1 in residents is not optimistic. Public education campaign may take the side effects of vaccine and the knowledge about the state's vaccination strategy into account.\n\nText: At the end of March 2009, an outbreak of novel influenza A (H1N1) (here after called A/H1N1) infection occurred in Mexico, followed by ongoing spread to all over the world in a short period [1] . On June 11 2009, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level to the highest level, phase 6 [2] , meaning that the A/H1N1 flu had spread in more than two continents and reached pandemic proportions. As of June 13, 2010, it had caused over 18,172 deaths in more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities [3] . Most illness, especially the severe illness and deaths, had occurred among healthy young adults, which was markedly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza [4, 5] .\n\nChina is highly susceptible to A/H1N1 because of its huge population and high residential density, besides the high infectiousness of this novel influenza virus. After the first imported case reported on May 11, 2009 , the confirmed cases were reported in various provinces of China [6] . By the late of October 2009, A/H1N1 cases had increased dramatically, with 44,981 cases and 6 deaths confirmed at the end of October 2009. The A/ H1N1 infection rate peaked in November 2009, when approximately 1500 new cases of A/H1N1 were being confirmed each day. By the end of this month, a total of 92,904 cases and 200 deaths had resulted from A/ H1N1-related causes [7] . The Chinese government has taken a series of preventive measures according to WHO guidelines, including the promotion of public knowledge about flu through mass media, patient isolation, quarantine of close contact person, and free vaccinations to population at high risk (e.g. young children, healthcare workers, and people with chronic disease) [8] . However, there were few public reports on the assessment of the effect of these policies and the level of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) associating with A/H1N1 among general population.\n\nIt is well-known that confused comprehension and negative attitude towards the emerging communicable disease may lead to unnecessary worry and chaos, even excessive panic which would aggravate the disease epidemic [9] . For instance, during SARS epidemic from 2002 to 2004, the misconceptions and the excessive panic of Chinese public to SARS led the public resistant to comply with the suggested preventive measures such as avoiding public transportation, going to hospital when they were sick, which contributed to the rapid spread of SARS and resulted in a more serious epidemic situation, making China one of the worst affected countries with over 5327 cases and 439 deaths [10, 11] . In addition, the panic of infectious disease outbreak could cause huge economic loss, for example the economic loss of SARS has been estimated at $30-$100 billion in US, though less than 10,000 persons were infected [12] . SARS experience has demonstrated the importance of monitoring the public perception in disease epidemic control, which may affect the compliance of community to the precautionary strategies. Understanding related factors affecting people to undertake precautionary behavior may also help decision-makers take appropriate measures to promote individual or community health. Therefore, it is important to monitor and analyze the public response to the emerging disease.\n\nTo investigate community responses to A/H1N1 in China, we conducted this telephone survey to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices of A/H1N1 among general population in China and put forward policy recommendations to government in case of future similar conditions.\n\nThis study was performed in seven urban regions (Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Jingzhou, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Shenzhen cities) and two rural areas (Jingzhou and Zhengzhou counties) of China with over one million people in each region. Regarding the urban sites, Beijing as the capital of China locates in the northeast; Shanghai is a municipality in the east of China; Wuhan (the provincial capital of Hubei) and Zhengzhou (the provincial capital of Henan province) are both in the centre of China; Xi'an in the northwest of China is the provincial capital of Shanxi province; and Shenzhen of the Guangdong province is in the southeast of China. As for the rural sites, Jingzhou county and Zhengzhou county, from Hubei and Henan provinces, respectively, both locate in the centre of China.\n\nThis current study was carried out in three phases during the pandemic peak season of A/H1N1. The first phase was from 30 November 2009 to 27 December 2009, the second from 4 January 2010 to 24 January 2010, and the third from 24 February to 25 March in 2010.\n\nA two-stage proportional probability to size (PPS) sampling method was used in each phase. In stage \u0406, about 30% of administrative regions in each study site were selected as primary sample units (PSUs) for cluster sampling. In stage II, telephone numbers were sampled randomly, of which the first four digitals were obtained from each PSU's post office as initial number and the other three or four digitals were obtained from random number generated by Excel 2003. Then each family was chosen as per unit (excluding school, hotel public or cell phone etc.) and at least 400 families in each site at each phase were selected finally. If the family was selected repeatedly or refused to answer the questionnaire, we added one to the last digit of phone number and dial again. If the line was busy or of no response, we would dial three times and then give up this phone number if there was still no respondent.\n\nAnonymous telephone interviews were conducted from 6:30 pm to 10:00 pm so as to avoid over-presenting the non-work population by well-trained interviewers with Bachelor degree of Epidemiology. The Questionnaire to Survey the Level of Knowledge, Attitude and Practice in Different Stages of A/H1N1 Pandemic by Telephone was designed by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC, Beijing). The majority of the questions were closed-ended and variables in the questionnaire were categorical, except age. The inclusion criteria of subjects were: age\u226518 and proper communication skills. There were seven questions related to the knowledge of A/H1N1, four referred to the attitude, and five concerning about the practice in this questionnaire (See additional file 1: The Questionnaire to Survey the Level of Knowledge, Attitude and Practice in Different Stages of H1N1 Pandemic by Telephone in China).\n\nThis study was approved by the institutional review board of the Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. All respondents were informed consent. We respected their wishes whether to accept our survey and promised to protect their secrets.\n\nAll data were entered into computer using Epidata V.3.1 and were analyzed in SPSS statistical software V.12. Chi-square test was applied to compare the immunization rates of the seasonal flu and A/H1N1 vaccine. The associations between the socio-demographic factors and the KAP regarding A/H1N1 were firstly investigated by using univariate odds ratios (OR) and then stepwise logistic regression modeling applied. Adjusting for such background variables including gender, age, level of education, occupation, region, and survey wave, stepwise multivariate logistic regression models were applied to investigate the impact factors associated with the risk perception of A/H1N1, A/H1N1 vaccination uptake and the compliance with suggested preventive measures (avoid crowd places/wash hand frequently/keep distance from people with influenza-like symptoms). For the purposes of analysis, the factor knowledge about the main modes of transmission was divided into two groups according to whether the respondents knew both cough and talk faceto-face can spread A/H1N1. Odds ratios and respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained from the logistic regression analysis. P values lower than 0.05 were judged to be statistically significant.\n\nA total of 88541 telephone numbers were dialed. Except 65323 invalid calls (including vacant numbers, fax numbers, busy tone numbers and non-qualified respondents whose age <18 and whose phones were from school, hotel or other public places), 23218 eligible respondents were identified. Among these respondents, 12360 completed the interview. Therefore, the response rate was 46.8%. Excluding missing, and logical erroneous data, 10669 questionnaires in total were eligible for analysis. The baseline characteristics of the respondents were presented in Table1. The mean age of all respondents was 41.47 years (over range: 18-90 year) . Of all respondents, 54.4% were female, and 42.4% had received college or above education (Table 1) .\n\nThe overall KAP related to A/H1N1 was reported in Table 2 . As to knowledge, 75.6% of all respondents knew that influenza could be transmitted by coughing and sneezing, and 61.9% thought that talking face-to-face was the transmission route, whereas 30.0% believed the transmission could be through food. Less than one third of respondents knew that virus could be transmitted by handshaking and indirect hand contact (26.8% and 22.3%, respectively). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that those with middle school (OR = 1.71; 95%CI 1.48-1.98), or having an education level of college and above (OR = 2.16; 95%CI 1.83-2.54) were more likely to know the transmission routes comparing with other people. Comparing with students, teachers (OR = 1.46; 95%CI 1.09-1.96) were more likely to answer the above questions Table  3 and Table 4 ). Regarding the A/H1N1vaccination, 69.9% respondents believed that the occurrence rate of adverse reactions caused by A/H1N1 vaccination was fairly low and they were not afraid of taking up vaccination. Most residents (96.1%) thought that the state's vaccination strategy was reasonable.\n\nAbout half of the respondents (42.9%) had avoided going to crowded places during the past two weeks of our survey. In case people nearby held influenza-like symptoms such as fever or cough, 56.9% increased the frequency of hand-washing and 57.4% would stay away from them. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated compliance with the preventive practices were more likely to be taken by those who were females (OR = 1. Table 3 and Table 4 ). The immunization rates of the seasonal flu and A/ H1N1 in respondents were 7.5% and 10.8% respectively. The multivariate stepwise models further showed that except the health care workers (OR = 1.52; 95%CI 1.09-2.11), residents in other occupations (OR = 0.06-0.67) were less likely to take up the A/H1N1 vaccination comparing with students (in Table 3 ). Adjusting for the background covariates the knowledge about the free vaccination policy (OR = 7.20; 95%CI 5.91-8.78) and the state's initial vaccination strategy(OR = 1.33; 95%CI 1.08-1.64), perception of daily life disturbed (OR = 1.29; 95% CI 1.11-1.50), practice of injecting the seasonal influenza vaccine (OR = 4.69; 95%CI 3.53-6.23) were significantly associated with behavior of taking up the A/H1N1 vaccination positively (in Table 5 ), and the adverse reaction of A/H1N1 vaccine negatively influenced people's practice (OR = 0.07; 95%CI 0.04-0.11).\n\nNovel A/H1N1 has caused pandemic in this century. It is important to encourage the public to adopt precautionary behaviors, which is based on the correct knowledge of the epidemic and appropriate response among residents. Many studies have examined the various levels of KAP about infectious disease outbreaks, such as SARS, avian influenza [13] [14] [15] . Some studies have been reported specifically on community responses to A/H1N1 in Australia and Europe [16, 17] . But through literature search, we haven't found any public reports on KAP regarding A/H1N1 among Chinese population until now. Therefore, we conducted this large population-based survey (10669 respondents) to investigate community responses to A/H1N1 and to provide baseline data to government for preventive measures in case of future outbreaks.\n\nUnless people have basic knowledge about the modes of transmission, they respond appropriately during an outbreak [16] . It has been proved that influenza is transmitted through person to person via respiratory secretions [18] . Most residents in our survey recognized that OR m : odds ratio obtained from stepwise multivariate logistics regression analysis using univariately significant variables as candidate variables and adjusting for region; NU: not significant in the univariate analysis; *: P < 0.05; \u2020: P < 0.01; \u2021: P < 0.0001.\n\nthe risk of getting infected would increase when an infected person coughed or sneezed in close distance. This may be due to the previous experience of SARS and avian flu. Multivariate analysis results showed that workers and farmers with lower education level were less likely to have this knowledge, which indicated that the contents and forms of propaganda should be more understandable and acceptable. A large proportion of residents in our survey overlooked the indirect hand contact and hand-shaking transmission route and about one third of public misconceived that A/H1N1 was food borne, which was associated with the previous knowledge of avian flu and the new A/H1N1 flu in the general population. The confusion with avian flu might mislead some residents to believe that the A/H1N1 virus is fatal and cause public panic [19] . Therefore, it is important for the government and health authorities to provide continuously updated information of the emerging disease through televisions, newspapers, radios, and Internet. There are regional differences in the perception of A/H1N1. For example, the public in Hong Kong did not perceive a high likelihood of having a local A/H1N1 outbreak [19] , but Malaysians were particularly anxious about the pandemic [20] . The current study shows that emotional distress was relatively mild in China as few residents worried about being infected (25.1%). This phenomenon may also be related to the previous experience of the SARS epidemic, as well as the open epidemic information. A survey in Korean university showed that women perceived higher illness severity and personal susceptibility to A/ H1N1 infection, which had been reconfirmed in our study [21] . Logistic regression analysis results suggested that women with higher educational level had higher perception of risk. As time went by, the knowledge about the main transmission route increased, but the risk perception of being infected in residents decreased, suggesting the positive effect of government policy regarding A/H1N1 infection prevention, as well as the promotion of the media.\n\nThe previous study presented various results of influencing factors on the the compliance with the preventive practices. The study in Saudi showed that older men with better education were more likely to take preventive practices [9] ; female students in Korean washed hands more frequently during the peak pandemic period of A/ H1N1 [21] ; in another pandemic study in USA, younger people was found to have greater uptake of recommended behaviors but not for gender [16] . We found female with higher education took more precautionary behaviors, but office staffs and farmers took less comparing with students. While such differences could result from study population demographics, profound differences may also exist in the knowledge of A/H1N1 and the perceptions of recommended behaviors in those countries. Adjusting for the background factors, the multivariate logistic regression showed the possible relationship between knowledge and risk perception, knowledge and practices (odd ratios were 1.57 and 2.09, respectively), which indicated that good knowledge is important to enable individuals to have better attitudes and practices in influenza risk reduction. Similar findings were observed in other studies performed during A/ H1N1 pandemic in Singapore [22] and during SARS pandemic in Hong Kong [13] . Therefore, it is important to focus on inculcating the correct knowledge to individuals as it will influence both attitudes and practices. Injecting vaccination is an effective measure to prevent infectious disease [23] . In China, the seasonal influenza vaccination is not included in the national immunization program and must be purchased by recipients. Those who are above 60 years old, the pupil and children in kindergarten, and people with chronic diseases are recommended to get inoculation. Data provided by China CDC in 2009 showed that the immunization rate of the seasonal flu in Chinese population was below 2% [24] , which was much lower than 7.5% in our study (P < 0.0001). This phenomenon is partly due to the state's prior vaccination strategy for population at high risk such as students, teachers, healthcare workers and people with chronic disease, as well as the confusion between seasonal flu vaccine and A/H1N1 vaccine in residents. People who couldn't access the A/H1N1 vaccine may take up seasonal flu vaccine as preventive behaviors. The A/ H1N1 vaccine was not available in China until the middle of September 2009. All populations at high risk above three years old were invited for vaccination free of charge [25] . A survey among 868 European travelers showed 14.2% participants were vaccinated against pandemic influenza A/H1N1 [26] , higher than 10.8% in our study (P < 0.01). Our study also showed students and health care workers were more likely to take up, which may be due to the prior vaccination strategy. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, which allowed us to adjust for background factors, further showed the perceived risk of infection and the knowledge about the main modes of transmission related to A/H1N1 vaccination were insignificantly, similar results seen in Lau's study [8] . Therefore, the vaccination rate of A/H1N1 is not expected to increase even if the virus becomes more prevalent or the knowledge of its transmission mode improved. Additionally, the behavior of taking up A/H1N1 vaccine was associated with perceptions of vaccine's safety and influence on daily life by A/H1N1 as well as the knowledge about the free vaccination policy and the state's initial vaccination strategy. This suggests that improving the safety of vaccine, the acceptability of side effect and the knowledge about the state's strategy related to A/H1N1 vaccination in residents may be helpful to promote A/H1N1 vaccination in the general population. The cross-sectional telephone survey adopted in the study has some limitations. We were unable to interview the people who did not have phones and the depth of the questionnaire was largely limited because questions and pre-existing answers could not be too long and complex. In addition, the telephone response rate was 46.8%, which means more than half of the interviewees rejected or didn't finish the survey. It was impossible to compare the difference between respondents and nonrespondents due to the lack of their basic information.\n\nThis A/H1N1 epidemic has not caused public panic yet, but the knowledge of A/H1N1 in residents is not optimistic as most of them confused the transmission route of A/H1N1. There are many factors influencing the KAP related to A/H1N1. Female with higher educational level had higher perceived risk of infection and took more precautionary behaviors. Public education campaign may take the side effects of vaccine and the knowledge about the state's vaccination strategy into account. The data collected in this survey could be used as baseline data to monitor public perceives and behaviors in the event of future outbreak of infectious disease in China.\n\nAdditional file 1: Questionnaire.

It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral\u2013fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral\u2013fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.\n\nText: Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. A human coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Most recently, an SARS-related CoV was implicated as the etiological agent responsible for the outbreak in Wuhan, central China. This outbreak is estimated to have started on 12th December 2019 and 17,332 laboratory confirmed cases with 361 deaths as of 3rd February 2020 in China [1] . The virus has spread to 23 other countries by travellers from Wuhan [1] . Typical symptoms are fever, malaise, shortness of breath and in severe cases, pneumonia [2] [3] [4] . The disease was first called unidentified viral pneumonia.\n\nWe quickly identified the etiological agent, termed 2019-nCoV (virus name designated by the World Health Organization). The newly identified virus is an SARS-related virus (SARSr-CoV) but shares only 74.5% genome identity to SARS-CoV [2] . We developed molecular detection tools based on viral spike genes. Our previous studies indicate that qPCR method can be used for the detection of 2019-nCoV in oral swabs or in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) [5] .\n\nAdditionally, we developed IgM and IgG detection methods using a cross-reactive nucleocapsid protein (NP) from another SARSr-CoV Rp3 [6] , which is 92% identical to 2019-nCoV NP. Using these serological tools, we demonstrate viral antibody titres increase in patients infected with 2019-nCoV [5] .\n\nLike SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV induced pneumonia through respiratory tract by clinical observation. Therefore, the presence of viral antigen in oral swabs was used as detection standard for 2019-nCoV. Similarly, two times of oral swabs negative in a 24-h interval was considered as viral clearance by patients officially.\n\nHere we launched an investigation of 2019-nCoV in a Wuhan hospital, aiming to investigate the other possible transmission route of this virus.\n\nHuman samples, including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood samples were collected by Wuhan pulmonary hospital with the consent from all patients and approved by the ethics committee of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases. Two investigations were performed. In the first investigation, we collected samples from 39 patients, 7 of which were in severe conditions. In the second investigation, we collected samples from 139 patients, yet their clinical records were not available. We only showed patients who were viral nucleotide detection positive. Patients were sampled without gender or age preference unless where indicated. For swabs, 1.5 ml DMEM+2% FBS medium was added in each tube. Supernatant was collected after 2500 rpm, 60 s vortex and 15-30 min standing. Supernatant from swabs were added to lysis buffer for RNA extraction. Serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000 g for 15 min within 24 h of collection, followed by 56\u00b0C 30 min inactivation, and then stored at 4\u00b0C until use.\n\nWhenever commercial kits were used, manufacturer's instructions were followed without modification. RNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcl of samples with the High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche). RNA was eluted in 50 \u03bcl of elution buffer and used as the template for RT-PCR. QPCR detection method based on 2019-nCoV S gene can be found in the previous study [5] . In brief, RNA extracted from above used in qPCR by HiScript\u00ae II One Step qRT-PCR SYBR\u00ae Green Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd). The 20 \u03bcl qPCR reaction mix contained 10 \u03bcl 2\u00d7 One Step SYBR Green Mix, 1 \u03bcl One Step SYBR Green Enzyme Mix, 0.4 \u03bcl 50 \u00d7 ROX Reference Dye 1, 0.4 \u03bcl of each primer (10 \u03bcM) and 2 \u03bcl template RNA. Amplification was performed as follows: 50\u00b0C for 3 min, 95\u00b0C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles consisting of 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and a default melting curve step in an ABI 7500 machine.\n\nIn-house anti-SARSr-CoV IgG and IgM ELISA kits were developed using SARSr-CoV Rp3 NP as antigen, which shared above 90% amino acid identity to all SARSr-CoVs, as reported previously [5] . For IgG test, MaxiSorp Nunc-immuno 96 well ELISA plates were coated (100 ng/well) overnight with recombinant NP. Human sera were used at 1:20 dilution for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. An anti-Human IgG-HRP conjugated monoclonal antibody (Kyab Biotech Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China) was used at a dilution of 1:40,000. The OD value (450-630) was calculated. For IgM test, Maxi-Sorp Nunc-immuno 96 wellELISA plates were coated (500 ng/well) overnight with anti-human IgM (\u00b5 chain). Human sera were used at 1:100 dilution for 40 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by anti-Rp3 NP-HRP conjugated (Kyab Biotech Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China) at a dilution of 1:4000. The OD value (450-630) was calculated.\n\nIn the first investigation, we aimed to test whether viral positive can be found in anal swab and blood as well as oral swabs. We conducted a molecular investigation to patients in Wuhan pulmonary hospital, who were detected as oral swabs positive for 2019-nCoV upon admission. We collected blood, oral swabs and anal swabs for 2019-nCoV qPCR test using previously established method [5] .\n\nWe found 15 patients who still carry virus following days of medical treatments. Of these patients, 8 were oral swabs positive (53.3%), 4 were anal swabs positive (26.7%), 6 blood positives (40%) and 3 serum positives (20%). Two patients were positive by both oral swab and anal swab, yet none of the blood positive was also swabs positive. Not surprisingly, all serum positives were also whole serum positive (Table 1 ). In summary, viral nucleotide can be found in anal swab or blood even if it cannot be detected in oral swabs. It should be noted that although swabs may be negative, the patient might still be viremic.\n\nWe then did another investigation to find out the dynamic changes of viral presence in two consecutive studies in both oral and anal swabs in another group of patients. The target patients were those who received around 10 days of medical treatments upon admission. We tested for both viral antibody and viral nucleotide levels by previously established method [5] . We showed that both IgM and IgG titres were relatively low or undetectable in day 0 (the day of first sampling). On day 5, an increase of viral antibodies can be seen in nearly all patients, which was normally considered as a transition from earlier to later period of infection ( Figure 1 and supplementary table 1 ). IgM positive rate increased from 50% (8/16) to 81% (13/16), whereas IgG positive rate increased from 81% (13/16) to 100% (16/16). This is in contrast to a relatively low detection positive rate from molecular test (below). For molecular detection, we found 8 oral swabs positive (50%) and 4 anal swabs (25%) in these 16 people on day 0. On day 5, we were only able to find 4 oral swabs positive (25%). In contrast, we found 6 anal swabs positive (37.5%). When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%). Another observation is the reoccurrence of virus in 6 patients who were detected negative on day 0. Of note, 4 of these 6 viral positives were from anal swabs ( Table 2) . These data suggested a shift from more oral positive during early period (as indicated by antibody titres) to more anal positive during later period might happen.\n\nWithin 1 month of the 2019-nCoV disease outbreak, we rapidly developed molecular and serological detection tools. This is the first molecular and serological study on this virus after the initial identification of 2019-NCoV from 7 patients diagnosed with unidentified viral pneumonia [5] . We detected the virus in oral swabs, anal swabs and blood, thus infected patients can potentially shed this pathogen through respiratory, fecal-oral or body fluid routes. In addition, we successfully applied serology test a large population and showed which could greatly improved detection positive rate.\n\nWe show that the current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019-nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative. In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected patients, intestinal infection was observed at later stages of infection [7] [8] [9] . However, patients infected with 2019-nCoV may harbour the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease. It is also worth to note none of the patients with viremia blood had positive swabs. These patients would likely be considered as 2019-nCoV negative through routine surveillance, and thus pose a threat to other people. In contrast, we found viral antibodies in near all patients, indicating serology should be considered for 2019-nCoV epidemiology. A possible shift from oral positive during early infection to anal swab positive during late infection can be observed. This observation implied that we cannot discharge a patient purely based on oral swabs negative, who may still shed the virus by oral-fecal route. Above all, we strongly suggest using viral IgM and IgG serological test to confirm an infection, considering the unreliable results from oral swabs detection.\n\nIn summary, we provide a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be transmitted through multiple routes.

Over the past decades, accumulating evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key regulatory roles in innate immunity. However, the involvement of host lncRNAs in hantaviral control remains uncharacterized. In this study, we identified the lncRNA NEAT1 as a vital antiviral modulator. NEAT1 was dramatically upregulated after Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection, whereas its downregulation in vitro or in vivo delayed host innate immune responses and aggravated HTNV replication. Ectopic expression of NEAT1 enhanced beta interferon (IFN-\u03b2) production and suppressed HTNV infection. Further investigation suggested that NEAT1 served as positive feedback for RIG-I signaling. HTNV infection activated NEAT1 transcription through the RIG-I\u2013IRF7 pathway, whereas NEAT1 removed the transcriptional inhibitory effects of the splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich protein (SFPQ) by relocating SFPQ to paraspeckles, thus promoting the expression of RIG-I and DDX60. RIG-I and DDX60 had synergic effects on IFN production. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that NEAT1 modulates the innate immune response against HTNV infection, providing another layer of information about the role of lncRNAs in controlling viral infections. IMPORTANCE Hantaviruses have attracted worldwide attention as archetypal emerging pathogens. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as key regulators of innate immunity; however, their roles in hantavirus infection remain unknown. In the present work, a new unexplored function of lncRNA NEAT1 in controlling HTNV replication was found. NEAT1 promoted interferon (IFN) responses by acting as positive feedback for RIG-I signaling. This lncRNA was induced by HTNV through the RIG-I\u2013IRF7 pathway in a time- and dose-dependent manner and promoted HTNV-induced IFN production by facilitating RIG-I and DDX60 expression. Intriguingly, NEAT1 relocated SFPQ and formed paraspeckles after HTNV infection, which might reverse inhibitive effects of SFPQ on the transcription of RIG-I and DDX60. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address the regulatory role of the lncRNA NEAT1 in host innate immunity after HTNV infection. In summary, our findings provide additional insights regarding the role of lncRNAs in controlling viral infections.\n\nText: glycoprotein (GP), and viral RNA-dependent polymerase protein (RdRp), respectively. Humans become infected by inhaling contaminated aerosols or by coming into contact with rodent excreta, and they develop two severe acute diseases, namely, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) (2) . Hantavirus infection affects up to 100,000 to 200,000 humans annually, with fulminant HFRS cases most represented in China (3) . Chinese HFRS cases, mainly caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection, account for approximately 90% of all global cases, with a mortality rate ranging from 0.1 to 15% (4) . Since there is neither an effective therapeutic nor FDA-licensed vaccine, further understanding of host immune responses against hantaviral infection is of great significance for global public health and safety. The innate immune system, characterized by interferon (IFN) responses and immunocyte activation, provides the initial defense against viral invasions. Cellular pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I like receptors (RLRs), can detect distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger the expression of IFNs and cytokines. RIG-I has been shown to recognize hantaviral invasion, but its regulatory process remains unclear (5) . Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important modulators of gene expression. lncRNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) is an essential architectural constituent of paraspeckles in the mammalian nucleus, interacting with Drosophila DBHS RNA-binding proteins such as the splicing factor proline-and glutamine-rich protein (SFPQ) and the non-POU domain-containing, octamer-binding protein (NONO/p54) (6) . To date, two isoform transcripts of the NEAT1 gene have been identified, namely, the 3.7-kb NEAT1-1 (MEN) and the 23-kb NEAT1-2 (MEN\u2424) (Fig. 1A) . A large amount of research has shown that NEAT1 is associated with oncogenesis and tumor progression (7) (8) (9) , promoting cancer formation in mice by dampening oncogene-dependent activation of p53 (10) . Nevertheless, studies assessing the function of NEAT1 in viral infections are scarce.\n\nHere, the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) transcriptome was analyzed after HTNV infection by digital gene expression (DGE) profiling, and lncRNA NEAT1 was found to be remarkably upregulated by viral infection. Silencing NEAT1 in vitro or in vivo suppressed host immune responses and aggravated HTNV infection, whereas NEAT1 overexpression in vitro enhanced beta interferon (IFN-\u2424) production and inhibited HTNV replication. Further investigation showed that NEAT1 promoted RIG-I and DDX60 expression by relocating SFPQ and removing the transcriptional inhibitory effects of SFPQ, which are critical for IFN responses against HTNV infection. We also found that RIG-I signaling, rather than TLR3 and TLR4, accounted for the elevation of HTNV-induced NEAT1. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism of host innate defense against HTNV infection.\n\nTo explore the potential role of long noncoding RNAs in host innate immune responses, DGE analysis of HUVECs for whole-genome profiling was performed at 24 h post-HTNV infection. As shown in Fig. 1B , the NEAT1 level in the HTNV group was higher than that in the mock group (P \u03ed 6.86 \u03eb 10 \u03ea13 , false discovery rate [FDR] \u03ed 9.75 \u03eb 10 \u03ea12 ) or the 60 Co-inactivated HTNV group (P \u03ed 1.75 \u03eb 10 \u03ea14 , FDR \u03ed 3.10 \u03eb 10 \u03ea13 ); however, the difference between the 60 Co-inactivated HTNV group and the mock group was not significant (P \u03ed 0.21034, FDR \u03ed 0.58211). To confirm the profiling results, two primer pairs from the published literature (11) , one recognizing both NEAT1-1 and NEAT1-2 and the other specific for NEAT1-2 (Fig. 1A) , were applied to quantify NEAT1 RNA isoforms by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). It has been reported that NEAT1-2 rather than NEAT1-1 plays a key regulatory role in paraspeckle formation (11) , and we also found that elevated NEAT1 levels depend on live HTNV infection rather than 60 Co-inactivated HTNV stimulation (Fig. 1C) . Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes specific for NEAT1-2 was performed with HUVECs, and the results confirmed increased NEAT1-2 expression and the aggregation of NEAT1-2 in the nucleus at 24 and 48 h postinfection (hpi) (Fig. 1D) .\n\nTo further investigate whether NEAT1 expression was altered in other cell lines, HEK293, HeLa, and A549 cells were used. All these cells could be infected by HTNV ( Fig.  1E and F) and generated hantavirus progeny (Fig. 1G ). Similar to the data obtained from HUVECs, NEAT1 was indeed upregulated by HTNV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 beginning at 24 hpi in HUVECs and A549, HEK293, and HeLa cells, and the increasing tendency occurred in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1H ). Of note, the NEAT1 elevation at 2 hpi might have been unrelated to the virus but resulted in cellular stress responses. Besides, NEAT1 expression increased from an MOI of 0.1 to 1, indicating that the elevation occurred in a viral dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1I) .\n\nNEAT1-2 and not NEAT1-1 suppresses HTNV replication in HUVECs. The abovedescribed data showed that HTNV infection increased NEAT1, and we wondered how NEAT1 could reciprocally influence HTNV replication. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection efficiency in HUVECs was confirmed by flow cytometry, and NEAT1 expression was significantly decreased, as assessed by qRT-PCR after RNA interference (RNAi) ( Fig. 2A) . Of note, si-NEAT1 targets both NEAT1-1 and NEAT1-2, whereas the stealth siRNA NEAT1-2 (st-NEAT1-2) is specific for NEAT1-2. Compared with the cells transfected with control siRNA (negative control [NC]), HUVECs with si-NEAT1 could dramatically promote HTNV NP production, and NP expression seemed to be related to the amount of applied si-NEAT1 (Fig. 2B) . Intriguingly, depletion of NEAT1-2 alone could mimic the antiviral effects of simultaneous NEAT1-1 and NEAT1-2 silencing (Fig. 2C) , indicating that NEAT1-2 was critical for the antiviral responses. Consistent with those data, the expressions of HTNV mRNA of S segment (Fig. 2D ) and HTNV titers (Fig. 2E ) were increased after NEAT1 silencing.\n\nOn the other hand, plasmids, of which pCMV-NEAT1-1 is transcribed into the 3.7-kb NEAT1-1 (MEN) and pCMV-NEAT1-2 is transcribed into the 2-to 3-kb NEAT1-2 (MEN\u2424), were applied to directly investigate the role of NEAT1 in HTNV infection (Fig. 2F) . Surprisingly, we found NEAT1-1 overexpression restricted NEAT1-2 transcription (Fig.  2F ). Overexpression of NEAT1 with both pCMV-NEAT1-1 and pCMV-NEAT1-2 could conspicuously repress HTNV NP expression, and NP expression seemed to be associated with the transfected plasmids (Fig. 2G) . Furthermore, overexpression of NEAT1-2 instead of NEAT1-1 could efficiently suppress HTNV replication (Fig. 2H ). NEAT1-1 upregulation even aggravated HTNV infection (Fig. 2H ), which may be the result of downregulation of NEAT1-2. Consistently, through analysis of viral load detected by qRT-PCR and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) test by ELISA, we found that expression of HTNV-specific mRNA (Fig. 2I ) and HTNV titers (Fig. 2J ) were limited in HUVECs in which NEAT1-2 was ectopically expressed in comparison to those transfected with control vector or pCMV-NEAT1-1. These data further showed that NEAT1-2 and not NEAT1-1 suppresses HTNV replication in HUVECs.\n\nAlteration of NEAT1-2 affects HTNV-induced IFN expression in HUVECs. IFN-\u2424 production or pretreatment at an early infection stage plays an important role in limiting HTNV infection, while IFN-\u2424 treatment after 24 hpi exerts little antiviral effect (12, 13) . It has been reported that the GnT of hantaviruses suppressed IFN-\u2424 expression of host cells at an early stage of infection (14) . Here, we also found that HUVECs could not efficiently produce IFN-\u2424 until 12 hpi at an MOI of 0.1 or until 24 hpi at an MOI of 1 (Fig. 3A) , which indicated that high doses of HTNV could hamper prompt IFN responses. Notably, enhanced NEAT1-2 transcription appeared at 8 hpi at an MOI of 0.1 or at 20 hpi at an MOI of 1 (Fig. 3B) , suggesting that NEAT1-2 expression increased just before IFN production. We found that expression of endogenous IFN-\u2424 mRNA was much lower in cells transfected with si-NEAT1-2 at MOIs of both 0.1 (Fig. 3C ) and 1 (Fig.  3D ) than in those transfected with control siRNA (NC). In contrast, overexpression of NEAT1 in HUVECs increased IFN-\u2424 expression after HTNV infection (MOI \u03ed 1) at 24 and 48 hpi (Fig. 3E ). More importantly, HUVECs transfected with pCMV-NEAT1-2 conspicuously increased IFN-\u2424 gene expression compared with those cells with vector plasmids at 12 hpi (MOI \u03ed 1), demonstrating that NEAT1-2 overexpression accelerated robust IFN responses in host cells against HTNV infection. With a dual luciferase reporter system Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells expressing FAM were calculated by flow cytometry. Right, HUVECs in six-well plates were transfected with NC sequences, si-NEAT1, or the stealth siRNA NEAT1-2 (st-NEAT1-2) (3 g). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were infected with HTNV at an MOI of 1. At 48 hpi, the NEAT1 expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR. Values are means \u03ee SD (n \u03ed 3; *, P \u03fd 0.01; **, P \u03fd 0.001; ***, P \u03fd 0.0001; Student's t test, compared with the NC group). NS, nonsignificant. (B) HUVECs in six-well plates were transfected with NC sequences (the amount of Si-NEAT1-2 is considered 0 g) or increasing amounts of si-NEAT1 (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 3 g). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were infected with HTNV at an MOI of 0.1 for 48 h. The expression of HTNV NP was measured by Western blotting. (C) HUVECs were treated as described for panel A, right, but at an MOI of 0.1. In-cell Western (ICW) analysis for HTNV NP was performed at 48 hpi.

(E) HUVECs were treated as described for panel A, right, but at an MOI of 0.1. The propagated HTNV was acquired at 72 hpi, and viral titers were detected by TCID 50 with ELISA in Vero E6 cells. Values are means \u03ee SD (n \u03ed 3; *, P \u03fd 0.01; Student's t test, compared with the NC group). (F) Left, HUVECs in six-well plates were transfected with vectors or pGFP (3 g). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were calculated by flow cytometry. Right, HUVECs in six-well plates were transfected with control plasmids (vector), pCMV-NEAT1-1, or pCMV-NEAT1-2 (3 g). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were infected with HTNV at an MOI of 1. At (Continued on next page) NEAT1 Promotes Innate Antiviral Responses Journal of Virology maintaining IFN-\u2424 promoters, we found NEAT1-2 silencing or overexpression could inhibit or increase the promoter activity of the IFN-\u2424 gene after HTNV infection, respectively, whereas silencing NEAT1-2 or ectopically expressing NEAT1-2 without HTNV infection could not inhibit or enhance IFN-\u2424 expression (Fig. 3F) . These results showed that NEAT1-2 regulated HTNV-induced IFN-\u2424 expression.\n\nTo explore whether the antihantavirus effects of NEAT1 were caused by IFN-\u2424 alteration, a series of compensatory experiments was designed. In NEAT1-2 knockdown HUVECs, the addition of IFN-\u2424 at 12 hpi could efficiently block HTNV NP production (MOI \u03ed 0.1), and such phenomena were also determined by the amount of applied IFN-\u2424 (Fig. 3G ). In addition, in cells with high NEAT1-2 expression, treatment with neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) of IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 could counteract the antiviral effects of NEAT1-2 (MOI \u03ed 1), and the compensatory effects were dependent on the magnitude of the NAbs. Together these results demonstrated that NEAT1-2 especially enhanced the host antihantaviral innate immune responses by regulating IFN-\u2424 signaling.\n\nRIG-I and DDX60 regulated by NEAT1-2 facilitate HTNV-induced IFN-\u2424 production. PRRs maintain a vital role in the promotion of IFN responses, and we conjectured that NEAT1 might amplify IFN responses by modulating these molecules. TLR3, TLR4, and RIG-I have been shown to recognize HTNV infection (5, 15, 16) . DDX60 was recently reported as an important activator of RIG-I, but the antiviral effects of DDX60 remain a subject of debate (17, 18) , Here, we found that multiple Toll-like receptors like TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4, as well as MDA5, were increased after HTNV infection, but none of them were influenced by silencing NEAT1-2 ( Fig. 4A ). The upregulated RIG-I and DDX60 were blocked in the cells with low NEAT1-2 expression after HTNV infection (Fig.  4A ). HUVECs with declining NEAT1-2 expression showed gradually decreasing expression of RIG-I and DDX60 (Fig. 4B) , and increasing NEAT1-2 transcription was found to activate RIG-I and DDX60 production accordingly (Fig. 4C ). These data indicated that NEAT1-2 could positively modulate RIG-I and DDX60 expression, while the role of RIG-I and DDX60 upon HTNV infection is obscure.\n\nWe then found that RIG-I and DDX60 colocalized after HTNV infection (Fig. 4D ), implying that RIG-I and DDX60 might collaborate with each other to exert antiviral effects. To verify the antiviral role of RIG-I and DDX60, we designed a series of siRNAs targeting RIG-I and DDX60, and we selected the si-RIG-I-2 and siRNA-DDX60-1 with the highest knockdown efficiency by qRT-PCR in HUVECs (data not shown). Simultaneously knocking down RIG-I and DDX60 significantly promoted HTNV NP expression (Fig. 4E ), and knockdown of both of them could greatly affect IFN-\u2424 expression ( Fig. 4F and G). Ectopic expression of either RIG-I or DDX60 inhibited viral replication, whereas overexpression of both resulted in superior antiviral effects (Fig. 4H ), indicating that efficient anti-HTNV responses might depend on the interactive effects of DDX60 and RIG-I. More importantly, RIG-I or/and DDX60 overexpression enhanced HTNV-induced IFN-\u2424 expression, and they had synergistic effects on IFN-\u2424 production ( Fig. 4I and J). Consequently, NEAT1 might regulate IFN-\u2424 production by upregulating RIG-I and DDX60, and thus we were interested in how NEAT1 regulated RIG-I and DDX60 expression.\n\nSFPQ, which is relocated by NEAT1 HTNV infection, regulates the expression of RIG-I and DDX60. NEAT1 was found to interact with SFPQ by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) after HTNV infection (Fig. 5A) , indicating that modulatory effects of NEAT1 48 hpi, the NEAT1 expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR. Values are means \u03ee SD (n \u03ed 3; *, P \u03fd 0.01; **, P \u03fd 0.001; ***, P \u03fd 0.0001; Student's t test, compared with the vector group). (G) HUVECs in six-well plates were transfected with control plasmids (vector, the amount of pCMV-NEAT1-1 plus pCMV-NEAT1-2 is considered 0 g) or increasing amounts of pCMV-NEAT1-1 plus pCMV-NEAT1-2 (0.05 \u03e9 0.05 g, 0.25 \u03e9 0.25 g, 0.5 \u03e9 0.5 g, 1.5 \u03e9 1.5 g, respectively). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were infected with HTNV at an MOI of 1 for 48 h. The expression of HTNV NP was measured by Western blotting. (H) HUVECs were treated as described for panel F, right. In-Cell Western (ICW) analysis for HTNV NP was performed at 48 hpi. The ICW for HTNV NP staining is shown on the left, while the relative intensity of fluorescence (NP/\u2424-actin) was analyzed using Student's t test. (n \u03ed 4; *, P \u03fd 0.01; **, P \u03fd 0.001; Student's t test, compared with the vector group). (H) HUVECs were treated as described for panel F, right. The expression of HTNV S segment was measured by qRT-PCR. Values are means \u03ee SD (n \u03ed 3; *, P \u03fd 0.01; **, P \u03fd 0.001; Student's t test, compared with the vector group). (I) HUVECs were treated as described for panel F, right. The propagated HTNV was acquired at 72 hpi, and viral titers were detected by TCID 50 with ELISA in Vero E6 cells. Values are means \u03ee SD (n \u03ed 3; *, P \u03fd 0.01; Student's t test, compared with the vector group). might be involved in SFPQ. Interestingly, the protein level of SFPQ, as well as another paraspeckle-forming constituent, NONO, remained unchanged after HTNV infection (Fig. 5B ) or after NEAT1 overexpression and knockdown (Fig. 5C ). However, SFPQ became centralized rather than diffuse in the nucleus after HTNV infection (Fig. 5D) . The enhanced interaction of SFPQ and NONO indicated excess formation of paraspeckles in the nucleus (Fig. 5E ) and relocalization of SFPQ. SFPQ knockdown could inhibit HTNV replication ( Fig. 5F and G), which might have been related to the increase in RIG-I (Fig.  5H ) and DDX60 (Fig. 5I ). SFPQ has been suggested to bind to the promoter region of RIG-I and DDX60 (11), thus preventing the expression of RIG-I and DDX60. Taken together, the above results suggested that NEAT1 might relocate SFPQ from the RIG-I signaling is crucial for NEAT1 expression after HTNV infection. Elevated NEAT1 exerts antiviral effects by modulating the innate immune response, yet it is unclear how HTNV triggers NEAT1 transcription. Interestingly, overexpression of the S or M segment of HTNV in HEK293 cells failed to induce NEAT1 expression, suggesting that NEAT1 transcription was closely related to live viral replication (Fig. 6A) . Of note, the upregulation of NEAT1 by HTNV could not be reversed by applying IFN-I neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 6B) . Meanwhile, NEAT1 expression could not be induced by stimulation with different types of IFNs (Fig. 6C, D, and E) or cytokines (Fig. 6F and G) .\n\nWe conjectured that NEAT1 expression was related to the activation of PRRs. By knocking down several PRRs, we found that the RIG-I and TLR4 pathways played important roles in HTNV-induced NEAT1 upregulation (Fig. 7A) . Using RIG-I-and TLR4-deficient cell lines which could be well infected by HTNV (Fig. 7B) , RIG-I was confirmed to be indispensable for NEAT1 induction after HTNV infection (Fig. 7C) . Moreover, using STAT1 as a positive control, we found that the transcription factor IRF7, rather than IRF3 and p65, translocated into the nucleus in HTNV-infected HUVECs at 2 dpi (Fig. 7D) . Furthermore, IRF7 knockdown blocked HTNV-induced NEAT1 upregulation (Fig. 7E) . Therefore, HTNV caused transcriptional activation of the NEAT1 gene, probably via the RIG-I-IRF7 pathway.\n\nNEAT1 silencing has profound effects on innate immune responses after HTNV infection in mice. Although cell-based experiments revealed that NEAT1-2 is a crucial regulator of innate antihantaviral responses, its function in vivo has remained unclear. To address this question, we intravenously injected siRNAs targeting mouse NEAT1-2 at 1 day before HTNV infection. NEAT1-2 expression levels in the liver, kidney, and spleen were reduced at 2 dpi (Fig. 8A) . Previous studies have shown that NEAT1 knockout does not affect physiological processes except potentia generandi in mice; hence, we assessed its role under pathological conditions. Body weight loss in NEAT1-2-depleted mice was observed from 2 dpi to 5 dpi, and the IFN production in serum was remarkably decreased in the NEAT1-2 silenced group than those in the NC group at 3 dpi (Fig. 8B) . As expected, NEAT1-2 knockdown mice showed considerably higher HTNV NP levels in the liver, spleen, and kidney at 3 dpi (Fig. 8C) . Moreover, the virus titers in related organs were higher in the NEAT1-2 silenced group than in the NC group (Fig.  8D ). In addition, reduced inflammatory cell filtration but increased tissue injury was found in NEAT1-2 knockdown mice during the early stage of infection (Fig. 8E) . Infiltration of macrophages in the spleen was attenuated (Fig. 8F) , and the activation of macrophages was also suppressed (by flow cytometry; data not shown). Moreover, CD8 \u03e9 IFN-\u2425 \u03e9 T cells were reduced in the spleens of NEAT1-2 knockdown mice in comparison to those in the NC group at 3 dpi (Fig. 8G) . Nevertheless, NEAT1-2 silencing had no effect on the production of neutralizing antibodies at 7 dpi (data not shown). The above-described findings indicated that NEAT1-2 depletion might influence multiple aspects of the innate immune response in HTNV-infected mice.\n\nInnate immunity is a phylogenetically ancient and conserved system that counteracts invading microbes, the regulatory mechanism of which is sophisticated and complex. Long noncoding RNAs, which were once considered dark materials in the mammalian genome, have been shown to exert vital modulatory effects on host innate immunity (19) . In this report, we first demonstrated that NEAT1 was induced by HTNV through the RIG-I-IRF7 pathway and served as positive feedback for RIG-I signaling.\n\nUsing DGE analysis, we observed upregulated NEAT1 and confirmed its alteration in To further determine the function of NEAT1 after HTNV infection in vivo, mice were injected intravenously with si-NEAT1-2 (1 g/g) or nontarget control siRNA (NC) (1 g/g); 1 day later, they were infected with HTNV (100 LD 50 ) by intramuscular injection. (A) To maintain high knockdown efficiency, siRNAs were injected intravenously every other day. (A) The knockdown efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR in kidney, liver, and spleen samples at 2 dpi (n \u03ed 6 in each group). (B) The effects of NEAT1 on HTNV virulence in mice were determined by body weight loss from 0 to 10 dpi (left panel, n \u03ed 10 in each group). The IFN-\u2424 in sera of different groups was measured by ELISA at 3dpi (right panel, n \u03ed 8 in each group). Values are means \u03ee SD (*, P \u03fd 0.01; **, P \u03fd 0.001; Student's t test, compared with the NC\u03e9HTNV group). (C) Mice were sacrificed at 3 dpi, and livers, spleens, and kidneys were collected for ELISA detection of HTNV NP titers (upper panels, n \u03ed 8 in each group) and qRT-PCR to assess HTNV S segment levels (bottom panels, n \u03ed 8 in each group) at 3 dpi. Values are means \u03ee SD (*, P \u03fd 0.01; **, P \u03fd 0.001; Student's t test, compared with the NC\u03e9HTNV group). (D) NEAT1 effects on HTNV infection kinetics at 3 dpi were determined by testing the HTNV titers in livers, spleens, and kidneys. Values are means \u03ee SD (n \u03ed 8; *, P \u03fd 0.01; **, P \u03fd 0.001; Student's t test, compared with the NC\u03e9HTNV group). (E) Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for mouse liver, spleen, or kidney specimens was performed (3 dpi, n \u03ed 8 in each group). After HTNV infection, livers in the NC group showed inflammatory cell infiltration in certain regions, while those in the si-NEAT1-2 group showed slight acute viral hepatitis. Spleens in the NC group showed lymph node hyperplasia, while those in the si-NEAT1-2 group were severely congestive. Kidneys in the NC group also showed inflammatory cell infiltration, while those in the si-NEAT1-2 group had moderate interstitial congestion. (F) Macrophage infiltration in spleens was analyzed by detecting CD11b and F4/80 by flow cytometry at 3 dpi, and the results obtained for four mice in each group are presented. (G) CD3 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 IFN-\u2425 \u03e9 T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry at 3 dpi, and the results obtained for three mice in each group are presented. different cell lines. To assess its effects on HTNV replication, NEAT1 was silenced both in vitro and in vivo, which resulted in increased HTNV infection and suppressed innate immune responses. Further analysis indicated that NEAT1 might interact with SFPQ and regulate DDX60 and RIG-I expression. By virtue of RNAi, the RIG-I-IRF7 pathway was confirmed to be necessary for HTNV-triggered NEAT1 elevation.\n\nRecently, large-scale transcriptomic studies identified numerous noncoding transcripts in the mammalian genome, which were speculated to influence diverse biological processes. Among these noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) emerged as important regulators of gene expression and are closely related to the activation of the host innate immune system. TLR2 controls lncRNA-COX2 expression in a MyD88-and NF-B-dependent manner, whereas lncRNA-COX either promotes interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion or represses ISG15 and CCL5 expression (20) . TLR2 activation or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423) stimulation induces transcription of the lncRNA THRIL, the downregulation of which impairs TNF-\u2423 and IL-6 secretion (21) . TLR4 signaling in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces lncRNA IL-1\u2424-eRNA and IL-1\u2424-RBT46, the knockdown of which attenuates IL-1\u2424 and CXCL8 release (22) . The lncRNA Lethe, triggered by TNF-\u2423 and IL-1\u2424, acts as a negative feedback regulator of NF-B signaling (23) .\n\nThe roles of lncRNAs in host-virus interactions have been progressively unveiled. Various viruses, such as influenza virus (IAV), coronavirus, enterovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and rabies virus, have been reported to activate the transcription of different lncRNAs in host cells (11, (24) (25) (26) . Importantly, multiple lncRNAs have been shown to affect the IFN response in recent years and have gradually become hot spots in the field of antiviral research. NeST was shown to enhance IFN-\u2425 production, controlling the susceptibility of mice to persistent Theiler's virus infection as well as resistance to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection (27) . Both CMPK2 and NRAV were identified as negative regulators of IFN immune reactions. CMPK2, induced by IFN-\u2423 or HCV infection, suppresses various ISGs, the knockdown of which dramatically blocks HCV replication (26) . NRAV inhibits some critical ISGs, such as IFITM3 and Mx1, the depletion of which suppresses IAV replication both in vitro and in vivo (25) . Numerous lncRNAs, including lnc-ISG15 and ISR2, respond to IFNs such as ISGs, although their actual function requires further investigation (28) . Considering the poor evolutionary conservation but rapid divergence of lncRNAs, their functions may be highly species and virus specific. Though considerable progress has been achieved to demonstrate the antiviral effects of lncRNAs on model viruses, there are no published reports assessing the role of lncRNAs in hantaviral infection. NEAT1 has been reported to interact with Drosophila DBHS RNA-binding proteins (e.g., SFPQ, NONO-p54nrb, and PSPC1), recruiting them to paraspeckles, a nuclear substructure found in all cultured and primary cells except embryonic stem cells (24) . The versatile function of NEAT1 is rapidly progressing in multiple areas of biology. NEAT1 has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple types of cancer (7) (8) (9) . NEAT1 also participates in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (29) and seems to potentially contribute to the elevated production of a number of cytokines and chemokines in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (30) . Furthermore, poly I\u00b7C can activate NEAT1 transcription through the TLR3 pathway, whereas NEAT1 positively regulates IL-8 transcription and potentially affects the expression of multiple ISGs after poly I\u00b7C stimulation (11) . In addition, NEAT1 has been reported to suppress the export of Rev-dependent instability element (INS)containing HIV-1 mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thus inhibiting HIV replication (24) . However, the role of NEAT1 in hantaviral infection remains unclear.\n\nIn this report, NEAT1 has been identified as an important regulator of the host innate immune system against HTNV infection. Elevated NEAT1 promotes IFN secretion, most likely by enhancing RIG-I and DDX60 expression. DDX60, a DEXD/H box RNA helicase similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ski2, is induced after viral infection (31) . DDX60 recognizes viral RNA and activates endogenous RIG-I, thereby promoting the RIG-I signaling-related IFN response. However, the antiviral effects of DDX60 seem to vary among viruses (17) . We found that NEAT1-regulated DDX60 was involved in IFN production in response to HTNV infection. In HTNV-infected cells, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) could not be detected, and it is unclear how host PRRs, especially RIG-I, recognize HTNV invasion (5) . Here, considering the interaction of RIG-I and DDX60 and the effect of DDX60 on IFN-\u2424 production, we hypothesize that DDX60 might mediate RIG-I signaling activation upon HTNV infection, which requires further investigation.\n\nOf note, we applied multiple cell lines to explore the role of NEAT1 during HTNV infection. HTNV primarily targets vascular endothelial cells in vivo and contributes to the increased vascular permeability and coagulation disorders in HFRS; hence, HUVECs are the most common in vitro cell model to study host innate immunity against HTNV infection or viral pathogenesis (32) . EVC-304 cells are also endovascular cells, whereas EVC-304 TLR4 \u03ea cells are TLR4-deleted cells, both of which have been used for HTNV infection related studies (15, 33) . A549 cells were once used to isolate HTNV, and they were confirmed to be a mature model of infection (34) (35) (36) (37) . Additionally, Huh 7.0 and Huh 7.5 (RIG-I \u03ea ) cells used in our study have been reported to be infected by HTNV by Lee et al. (5) and can be used as a cell model to study immune responses against HTNV replication (38, 39) . Additionally, HEK293 (40) and HeLa (41) cells have been reported to be infected by HTNV. Using qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence assays, we have also shown that both HEK293 and HeLa cells can be infected by HTNV.\n\nTo study the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of NEAT1 on IFN expression and HTNV infection, it may be suitable to use HEK293 and HeLa cells as a cell model, especially under conditions in which HTNV NP can be detected using Western blot or immunofluorescence analyses.\n\nIn experiments to assess the effect of NEAT1 on the control of hantaviruses, In-Cell Western (ICW) analysis was applied to qualify HTNV NP production. Alterations in the relative fluorescence intensity of NP after silencing or overexpressing NEAT1-2 did not seem to be as remarkable as qRT-PCR or Western blot analysis results. The NP spotted and exhibited in the ICW results forms obvious stains that mimic PFU. However, the specific values scanned and analyzed by the ICW assay reflect only the fluorescence intensity of the integral well instead of the number of spots. As a consequence, the intensity represented the quantity of NP production but could not directly indicate the virulence, which was better shown by plaque-forming assays. The RNAi studies in vivo are encouraging (Fig. 8) , but the NC used by our group was not mutated si-NEAT1-2 (i.e., same sense strand, but with a point mutation in the targeting strand). The results would be more compelling if the control mice had been treated with the mutated si-NEAT1-2.\n\nOne major finding of our study is that the lncRNA NEAT1 serves as positive feedback for RIG-I signaling. After observing that NEAT1 can regulate IFN expression by HTNV infection, we were interested in the function of NEAT1. We noticed that silencing NEAT1-2 or ectopically expressing NEAT1-2 could not inhibit or enhance IFN expression without HTNV infection (Fig. 3F) , which indicated that NEAT1-2 could not directly affect IFN-\u2424 expression. This finding excludes the possibility that NEAT1-2 directly promoted IFN-\u2424 and that IFN-\u2424 promoted the expression of PRRs such as RIG-I. Thereafter, NEAT1 was found to modulate HTNV-induced RIG-I and DDX60 expression. Recent findings have shown that RIG-I signaling is essential for an efficient polyfunctional T cell response during IAV infection (42) . Indeed, we found that the function of T cells was suppressed after NEAT1-2 depletion in our animal experiments (Fig. 8G) , which might be due to the disrupted RIG-I signaling in NEAT1-2 silenced T cells.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the first study to describe the role of NEAT1 in HTNV infection. HTNV infection induced NEAT1 expression through the RIG-I-IRF7 pathway, while NEAT1 displayed positive feedback for RIG-I signaling. NEAT1 relocated SFPQ from the potential promoter region of several antiviral genes to the paraspeckles, removing the transcriptional inhibitory effects of SFPQ. This phenomenon would facilitate the expression of DDX60 and RIG-I, thus promoting IFN responses and suppressing HTNV infection (Fig. 9) . nontarget control (i.e., negative control [NC]) or targeted RIG-I and DDX60 were designed by Gene-Pharma as follows: NC, 5=- UUCUUCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3=; si-RIG-I-1, 5=-GCCCAUUUAAACCAAGAAATT-3=, si-RIG-I-2, 5=-GGUGGAGGAUAUUUGAACUTT-3=, and si-RIG-I-3, 5=-CCCAACGAUAUCAUUUCUTT-3=; si-DDX60-1, 5=-GUCCAGGUGUCAGUUUGAUTT-3=, si-DDX60-2, 5=-CCGAAGUGAAGAAGGUAAATT-3=, and si-DDX60-3, 5=-GAUGGAUGCUAGGAAAUAUTT-3=. The pCMV-NEAT1-1 and pCMV-NEAT1-2 plasmids, which transcribe NEAT1-1 and NEAT1-2, respectively, were provided by Nakagawa Shinichi (10) . The Flag-RIG-I and pUNO-DDX60 plasmids were purchased from Invitrogen.\n\nReagents. Mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1A8 for the HTNV nucleocapsid protein (NP) was produced as previously described (43) . Abs against RIG-I, IRF3, IRF7, p65, and STAT1, as well as the neutralizing antibodies against IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424, were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and Ab against DDX60 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Abs against SFPQ, NONO, GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and \u2424-actin were purchased from Protein Tech, Inc. (Wuhan, China). The Abs targeting CD11b, F4/80, CD3, CD8, IFN-\u2425, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and CD206 for flow cytometry were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). IFN-\u2423, -\u2424, and -\u2425, TNF-\u2423, and IL-1\u2424 were from PeperoTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). ELISA kits for IFN-\u2424 detection were manufactured by R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN, USA) .\n\nRNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Total cellular RNAs were extracted with RNAiso (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), the concentration of which was measured using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer. Reverse transcription (RT) was then performed with PrimeScript RT master mix (TaKaRa) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Each cDNA was denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and amplified for 40 cycles of 15 s at 98\u00b0C, 30 s at 58\u00b0C, and 30 s at 72\u00b0C using a LightCycler 96 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The mRNA expression level of each target gene was normalized to the respective \u2424-actin and analyzed. The qRT-PCR primer sequences for NEAT1, NEAT1-2, IFN-\u2424, HTNV S segment, RIG-I, DDX60, \u2424-actin, and GAPDH were obtained from previous reports (24, 45) . The methods used to quantify HTNV RNA load have been described by our group previously (46) . DGE analysis and lncRNA sequencing. HUVECs with a confluence of 80% in 6 wells were mock infected or infected with live or 60 Co-inactivated HTNV at an MOI of 1. RNAs were extracted as previously described at 24 hpi, and the quality was analyzed using FastQC software by the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, Shenzhen, China). Digital gene expression (DGE) tags were annotated to the human transcriptome (Ensembl version 58) by mapping the reads to the sequence flanking NlaIII restriction sites on both coding and noncoding strands. Tags matching more than one gene region were discarded. Tag counts were normalized to TPM (transcripts per million) by dividing the raw tag count by the total number of tags from each library and multiplying by 1 million. To avoid the possible noise signal from high-throughput sequencing, the genes with average TPM of less than 1 in these three states were excluded. In this study, an absolute fold change of no less than 1.5 and a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.001 were used to define the differentially expressed genes. Genes were selected as differentially expressed using a P value threshold of 0.01. Genes were selected as differentially expressed using a P value threshold of 0.01.\n\nFISH and immunofluorescence assays (IFA). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed with a FISH kit (Ribobio Co.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Prehybridization was performed with lncRNA FISH probe mix at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, and then hybridization was performed by adding NEAT1-2 FISH probe mix and incubating the mixture at 37\u00b0C overnight. After washing with 4\u03eb, 2\u03eb, and 1\u03eb SSC, the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Finally, the samples were observed using a BX60 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nIFA was performed after FISH or independently. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Primary Abs were added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. After five washes with DPBS, secondary Cy3-or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (Sangon, Shanghai, China) was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. Finally, the samples were observed using a BX60 fluorescence microscope (Olympus).\n\nCells were washed twice with ice-cold DPBS and lysed with 1\u03eb SDS protein loading buffer (50 mM Tris, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromophenol blue). The samples were then boiled at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. The lysates were resolved by 10%, 12%, or 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies, followed by secondary antibodies labeled with infrared dyes (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). The signals on the PVDF membrane were visualized using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA).\n\nICW assay. The In-Cell Western (ICW) assay was performed using an Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HUVECs were either mock transfected or transfected with NC sequences, si-NEAT1, st-NEAT1-2, vector plasmids, pCMV-NEAT1-1, or pCMV-NEAT1-2 and grown in 96-well plates (2 \u03eb 10 4 cells/well). Twenty-four hours posttransfection, the cells were either infected or mock infected with HTNV at an MOI of 1. At 48 hpi, HUVECs were washed twice with ice-cold DPBS, fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min, and permeabilized with 1.0% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Cells were added with Li-Cor Odyssey blocking solution at room temperature for 30 min and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with mouse IgG MAb 1A8 against HTNV NP together with rabbit IgG antibody against \u2424-actin, both of which were diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; HyClone). Subsequently, the cells were washed and stained with goat anti-mouse IgG IRDye 800 antibody (1:5,000; Li-Cor) and goat anti-rabbit", "document_id": 2652}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What symptoms were reported?", "id": 3820, "answers": [{"text": "Of the remaining 29, 20 reported fever, 14 reported cough and eight reported weakness.

As at 21 February, nine European countries reported 47 cases. Among 38 cases studied, 21 were linked to two clusters in Germany and France, 14 were infected in China. Median case age was 42 years; 25 were male. Late detection of the clusters' index cases delayed isolation of further local cases. As at 5 March, there were 4,250 cases.\n\nA cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1] . On 12 January 2020, Chinese authorities shared the sequence of a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolated from some clustered cases [2] . Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) . As at 21 February 2020, the virus had spread rapidly mostly within China but also to 28 other countries, including in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region [3] [4] [5] .\n\nHere we describe the epidemiology of the first cases of COVID-19 in this region, excluding cases reported in the United Kingdom (UK), as at 21 February 2020. The study includes a comparison between cases detected among travellers from China and cases whose infection was acquired due to subsequent local transmission.\n\nOn 27 January 2020, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe asked countries to complete a WHO standard COVID-19 case report form for all confirmed and probable cases according to WHO criteria [6] [7] [8] . The overall aim of surveillance at this time was to support the global strategy of containment of COVID-19 with rapid identification and follow-up of cases linked to affected countries in order to minimise onward transmission. The surveillance objectives were to: describe the key epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases detected in Europe; inform country preparedness; and improve further case detection and management. Data collected included demographics, history of recent travel to affected areas, close contact with a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, underlying conditions, signs and symptoms of disease at onset, type of specimens from which the virus was detected, and clinical outcome. The WHO case definition was adopted for surveillance: a confirmed case was a person with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (ECDC recommended two separate SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests), irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms, whereas a probable case was a suspect case for whom testing for SARS-CoV-2 was inconclusive or positive using a pan-coronavirus assay [8] . By 31 January 2020, 47 laboratories in 31 countries, including 38 laboratories in 24 European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries, had diagnostic capability for SARS-CoV-2 available (close to 60% of countries in the WHO European Region), with cross-border shipment arrangements in place for many of those lacking domestic testing capacity. The remaining six EU/EEA countries were expected to have diagnostic testing available by mid-February [9] .\n\nAs at 09:00 on 21 February 2020, 47 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in the WHO European Region and one of these cases had died [4] . Data on 38 of these cases (i.e. all except the nine reported in the UK) are included in this analysis.\n\nThe first three cases detected were reported in France on 24 January 2020 and had onset of symptoms on 17, 19 and 23 January respectively [10] . The first death was reported on 15 February in France. As at 21 February, nine countries had reported cases ( Figure) : Belgium (1), Finland (1), France (12), Germany (16), Italy (3), Russia (2), Spain (2), Sweden (1) and the UK (9 -not included further).\n\nThe place of infection (assessed at national level based on an incubation period presumed to be up to 14 days [11] , travel history and contact with probable or confirmed cases as per the case definition) was reported for 35 cases (missing for three cases), of whom 14 were infected in China (Hubei province: 10 cases; Shandong province: one case; province not reported for three cases). The remaining 21 cases were infected in Europe. Of these, 14 were linked to a cluster in Bavaria, Germany, and seven to a cluster in Haute-Savoie, France [12, 13] . Cases from the Bavarian cluster were reported from Germany and Spain, whereas cases from the Haute-Savoie cluster were reported from France All but two cases were hospitalised (35 of 37 where information on hospitalisation was reported), although it is likely that most were hospitalised to isolate the person rather than because of severe disease. The time from onset of symptoms to hospitalisation (and isolation) ranged between 0 and 10 days with a mean of 3.7 days (reported for 29 cases). The mean number of days to hospitalisation was 2.5 days for cases imported from China, but 4.6 days for those infected in Europe. This was mostly a result of delays in identifying the index cases of the two clusters in France and Germany. In the German cluster, for example, the first three cases detected locally were hospitalised in a mean of 5.7 days, whereas the following six took only a mean of 2 days to be hospitalised.\n\nSymptoms at the point of diagnosis were reported for 31 cases. Two cases were asymptomatic and remained so until tested negative. The asymptomatic cases were tested as part of screening following repatriation and during contact tracing respectively. Of the remaining 29, 20 reported fever, 14 reported cough and eight reported weakness. Additional symptoms reported included headaches (6 cases), sore throat (2), rhinorrhoea (2), shortness of breath (2), myalgia (1), diarrhoea (1) and nausea (1). Fever was reported as the sole symptom for nine cases. In 16 of 29 symptomatic cases, the symptoms at diagnosis were consistent with the case definition for acute respiratory infection [16] , although it is possible that cases presented additional symptoms after diagnosis and these were not reported.\n\nData on pre-existing conditions were reported for seven cases; five had no pre-existing conditions while one was reported to be obese and one had pre-existing cardiac disease. No data on clinical signs e.g. dyspnea etc. were reported for any of the 38 cases.\n\nAll hospitalised cases had a benign clinical evolution except four, two reported in Italy and two reported in France, all of whom developed viral pneumonia. All three cases who were aged 65 years or over were admitted to intensive care and required respiratory support and one French case died. The case who died was hospitalised for 21 days and required intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 19 days. The duration of hospitalisation was reported for 16 cases with a median of 13 days (range: 8-23 days). As at 21 February 2020, four cases were still hospitalised.\n\nAll cases were confirmed according to specific assays targeting at least two separate genes (envelope (E) gene as a screening test and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene or nucleoprotein (N) gene for confirmation) [8, 17] . The specimen types tested were reported for 27 cases: 15 had positive nasopharyngeal swabs, nine had positive throat swabs, three cases had positive sputum, two had a positive nasal swab, one case had a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate and one a positive endotracheal aspirate.\n\nAs at 09:00 on 21 February, few COVID-19 cases had been detected in Europe compared with Asia. However the situation is rapidly developing, with a large outbreak recently identified in northern Italy, with transmission in several municipalities and at least two deaths [18] . As at 5 March 2020, there are 4,250 cases including 113 deaths reported among 38 countries in the WHO European region [19] .\n\nIn our analysis of early cases, we observed transmission in two broad contexts: sporadic cases among travellers from China (14 cases) and cases who acquired infection due to subsequent local transmission in Europe (21 cases). Our analysis shows that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation/case isolation was about 3 days longer for locally acquired cases than for imported cases. People returning from affected areas are likely to have a low threshold to seek care and be tested when symptomatic, however delays in identifying the index cases of the two clusters in France and Germany meant that locally acquired cases took longer to be detected and isolated. Once the exposure is determined and contacts identified and quarantined (171 contacts in France and 200 in Germany for the clusters in Haute-Savoie and Bavaria, respectively), further cases are likely to be rapidly detected and isolated when they develop symptoms [15, 20] . In the German cluster, for example, the first three cases detected locally were hospitalised in a mean of 5.7 days, whereas the following six were hospitalised after a mean of 2 days. Locally acquired cases require significant resources for contact tracing and quarantine, and countries should be prepared to allocate considerable public health resources during the containment phase, should local clusters emerge in their population. In addition, prompt sharing of information on cases and contacts through international notification systems such as the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism and the European Commission's European Early Warning and Response System is essential to contain international spread of infection.\n\nAll of the imported cases had a history of travel to China. This was consistent with the epidemiological situation in Asia, and supported the recommendation for testing of suspected cases with travel history to China and potentially other areas of presumed ongoing community transmission. The situation has evolved rapidly since then, however, and the number of countries reporting COVID-19 transmission increased rapidly, notably with a large outbreak in northern Italy with 3,089 cases reported as at 5 March [18, 19] . Testing of suspected cases based on geographical risk of importation needs to be complemented with additional approaches to ensure early detection of local circulation of COVID-19, including through testing of severe acute respiratory infections in hospitals irrespectively of travel history as recommended in the WHO case definition updated on 27 February 2020 [21] .\n\nThe clinical presentation observed in the cases in Europe is that of an acute respiratory infection. However, of the 31 cases with information on symptoms, 20 cases presented with fever and nine cases presented only with fever and no other symptoms. These findings, which are consistent with other published case series, have prompted ECDC to include fever among several clinical signs or symptoms indicative for the suspected case definition.\n\nThree cases were aged 65 years or over. All required admission to intensive care and were tourists (imported cases). These findings could reflect the average older age of the tourist population compared with the local contacts exposed to infection in Europe and do not allow us to draw any conclusion on the proportion of severe cases that we could expect in the general population of Europe. Despite this, the finding of older individuals being at higher risk of a severe clinical course is consistent with the evidence from Chinese case series published so far although the majority of infections in China have been mild [22, 23] .\n\nThis preliminary analysis is based on the first reported cases of COVID-19 cases in the WHO European Region. Given the small sample size, and limited completeness for some variables, all the results presented should be interpreted with caution.\n\nWith increasing numbers of cases in Europe, data from surveillance and investigations in the region can build on the evidence from countries in Asia experiencing more widespread transmission particularly on disease spectrum and the proportion of infections with severe outcome [22] . Understanding the infection-severity is critical to help plan for the impact on the healthcare system and the wider population. Serological studies are vital to understand the proportion of cases who are asymptomatic. Hospital-based surveillance could help estimate the incidence of severe cases and identify risk factors for severity and death. Established hospital surveillance systems that are in place for influenza and other diseases in Europe may be expanded for this purpose. In addition, a number of countries in Europe are adapting and, in some cases, already using existing sentinel primary care based surveillance systems for influenza to detect community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This approach will be used globally to help identify evidence of widespread community transmission and, should the virus spread and containment no longer be deemed feasible, to monitor intensity of disease transmission, trends and its geographical spread.\n\nAdditional research is needed to complement surveillance data to build knowledge on the infectious period, modes of transmission, basic and effective reproduction numbers, and effectiveness of prevention and case management options also in settings outside of China. Such special studies are being conducted globally, including a cohort study on citizens repatriated from China to Europe, with the aim to extrapolate disease incidence and risk factors for infection in areas with community transmission. Countries together with ECDC and WHO, should use all opportunities to address these questions in a coordinated fashion at the European and global level.\n\nprovided input to the outline, multiple versions of the manuscript and gave approval to the final draft.", "document_id": 2642}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What growing dysjunction has been witnessed?", "id": 4123, "answers": [{"text": "a 'Valley of Death' 1,2 no less, between broadening strides in fundamental biomedical research and their incommensurate reach into the clinic.

Plumbing work on research funding and development pipelines through recent changes in the structure of government funding, 2 new public and private joint ventures and specialist undergraduate and postgraduate courses now aim to incorporate pathways to translation at the earliest stages. Reflecting this shift, the number of biomedical research publications targeting 'translational' concepts has increased exponentially, up 1800% between 2003 and 2014 3 and continuing to rise rapidly up to the present day. Fuelled by the availability of new research technologies, as well as changing disease, cost and other pressing issues of our time, further growth in this exciting space will undoubtedly continue. Despite recent advances in the therapeutic control of immune function and viral infection, current therapies are often challenging to develop, expensive to deploy and readily select for resistance-conferring mutants. Shaped by the hostvirus immunological 'arms race' and tempered in the forge of deep time, the biodiversity of our world is increasingly being harnessed for new biotechnologies and therapeutics. Simultaneously, a shift towards host-oriented antiviral therapies is currently underway. In this Clinical & Translational Immunology Special Feature, I illustrate a strategic vision integrating these themes to create new, effective, economical and robust antiviral therapies and immunotherapies, with both the realities and the opportunities afforded to researchers working in our changing world squarely in mind.\n\nOpening this CTI Special Feature, I outline ways these issues may be solved by creatively leveraging the so-called 'strengths' of viruses. Viral RNA polymerisation and reverse transcription enable resistance to treatment by conferring extraordinary genetic diversity. However, these exact processes ultimately restrict viral infectivity by strongly limiting virus genome sizes and their incorporation of new information. I coin this evolutionary dilemma the 'information economy paradox'. Many viruses attempt to resolve this by manipulating multifunctional or multitasking host cell proteins (MMHPs), thereby maximising host subversion and viral infectivity at minimal informational cost. 4 I argue this exposes an 'Achilles Heel' that may be safely targeted via host-oriented therapies to impose devastating informational and fitness barriers on escape mutant selection. Furthermore, since MMHPs are often conserved targets within and between virus families, MMHP-targeting therapies may exhibit both robust and broadspectrum antiviral efficacy. Achieving this through drug repurposing will break the vicious cycle of escalating therapeutic development costs and trivial escape mutant selection, both quickly and in multiple places. I also discuss alternative posttranslational and RNA-based antiviral approaches, designer vaccines, immunotherapy and the emerging field of neo-virology. 4 I anticipate international efforts in these areas over the coming decade will enable the tapping of useful new biological functions and processes, methods for controlling infection, and the deployment of symbiotic or subclinical viruses in new therapies and biotechnologies that are so crucially needed.\n\nUpon infection, pathogens stimulate expression of numerous host inflammatory factors that support recruitment and activation of immune cells. On the flip side, this same process also causes immunopathology when prolonged or deregulated. 5 In their contribution to this Special Feature, Yoshinaga and Takeuchi review endogenous RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that post-transcriptionally control expression of crucial inflammatory factors in various tissues and their potential therapeutic applications. 6 These RBPs include tristetraprolin and AUF1, which promote degradation of AU-rich element (ARE)-containing mRNA; members of the Roquin and Regnase families, which respectively promote or effect degradation of mRNAs harbouring stem-loop structures; and the increasingly apparent role of the RNA methylation machinery in controlling inflammatory mRNA stability. These activities take place in various subcellular compartments and are differentially regulated during infection. In this way, mRNA-destabilising RBPs constitute a 'brake' on the immune system, which may ultimately be toggled therapeutically. I anticipate continued efforts in this area will lead to new methods of regaining control over inflammation in autoimmunity, selectively enhancing immunity in immunotherapy, and modulating RNA synthesis and virus replication during infection.\n\nAnother mRNA under post-transcriptional regulation by Regnase-1 and Roquin is Furin, which encodes a conserved proprotein convertase crucial in human health and disease. Furin, along with other PCSK family members, is widely implicated in immune regulation, cancer and the entry, maturation or release of a broad array of evolutionarily diverse viruses including human papillomavirus (HPV), influenza (IAV), Ebola (EboV), dengue (DenV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Here, Braun and Sauter review the roles of furin in these processes, as well as the history and future of furin-targeting therapeutics. 7 They also discuss their recent work revealing how two IFN-cinducible factors exhibit broad-spectrum inhibition of IAV, measles (MV), zika (ZikV) and HIV by suppressing furin activity. 8 Over the coming decade, I expect to see an ever-finer spatiotemporal resolution of host-oriented therapies to achieve safe, effective and broad-spectrum yet costeffective therapies for clinical use.\n\nThe increasing abundance of affordable, sensitive, high-throughput genome sequencing technologies has led to a recent boom in metagenomics and the cataloguing of the microbiome of our world. The MinION nanopore sequencer is one of the latest innovations in this space, enabling direct sequencing in a miniature form factor with only minimal sample preparation and a consumer-grade laptop computer. Nakagawa and colleagues here report on their latest experiments using this system, further improving its performance for use in resource-poor contexts for meningitis diagnoses. 9 While direct sequencing of viral genomic RNA is challenging, this system was recently used to directly sequence an RNA virus genome (IAV) for the first time. 10 I anticipate further improvements in the performance of such devices over the coming decade will transform virus surveillance efforts, the importance of which was underscored by the recent EboV and novel coronavirus (nCoV / COVID-19) outbreaks, enabling rapid deployment of antiviral treatments that take resistance-conferring mutations into account.\n\nDecades of basic immunology research have provided a near-complete picture of the main armaments in the human antiviral arsenal. Nevertheless, this focus on mammalian defences and pathologies has sidelined examination of the types and roles of viruses and antiviral defences that exist throughout our biosphere. One case in point is the CRISPR/Cas antiviral immune system of prokaryotes, which is now repurposed as a revolutionary gene-editing biotechnology in plants and animals. 11 Another is the ancient lineage of nucleocytosolic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs), which are emerging human pathogens that possess enormous genomes of up to several megabases in size encoding hundreds of proteins with unique and unknown functions. 12 Moreover, hundreds of human-and avian-infective viruses such as IAV strain H5N1 are known, but recent efforts indicate the true number may be in the millions and many harbour zoonotic potential. 13 It is increasingly clear that host-virus interactions have generated truly vast yet poorly understood and untapped biodiversity. Closing this Special Feature, Watanabe and Kawaoka elaborate on neo-virology, an emerging field engaged in cataloguing and characterising this biodiversity through a global consortium. 14 I predict these efforts will unlock a vast wealth of currently unexplored biodiversity, leading to biotechnologies and treatments that leverage the host-virus interactions developed throughout evolution.\n\nWhen biomedical innovations fall into the 'Valley of Death', patients who are therefore not reached all too often fall with them. Being entrusted with the resources and expectation to conceive, deliver and communicate dividends to society is both cherished and eagerly pursued at every stage of our careers. Nevertheless, the road to research translation is winding and is built on a foundation of basic research. Supporting industry-academia collaboration and nurturing talent and skills in the Indo-Pacific region are two of the four pillars of the National Innovation and Science Agenda. 2 These frame Australia's Medical Research and Innovation Priorities, which include antimicrobial resistance, global health and health security, drug repurposing and translational research infrastructure, 15 capturing many of the key elements of this CTI Special Feature. Establishing durable international relationships that integrate diverse expertise is essential to delivering these outcomes. To this end, NHMRC has recently taken steps under the International Engagement Strategy 16 to increase cooperation with its counterparts overseas. These include the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), tasked with translating the biomedical research output of that country. Given the reciprocal efforts at accelerating bilateral engagement currently underway, 17 the prospects for new areas of international cooperation and mobility have never been more exciting nor urgent. With the above in mind, all contributions to this CTI Special Feature I have selected from research presented by fellow invitees to the 2018 Awaji International Forum on Infection and Immunity (AIFII) and 2017 Consortium of Biological Sciences (ConBio) conferences in Japan. Both Australia and Japan have strong traditions in immunology and related disciplines, and I predict that the quantity, quality and importance of our bilateral cooperation will accelerate rapidly over the short to medium term. By expanding and cooperatively leveraging our respective research strengths, our efforts may yet solve the many pressing disease, cost and other sustainability issues of our time.", "document_id": 2669}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What serious question was raised?", "id": 3847, "answers": [{"text": "as to whether or not our seasonal or pandemic flu might have another reservoir host.", "answer_start": 464}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is a recent discovery?", "id": 3848, "answers": [{"text": "Bat is believed to harbor many more viruses than we ever thought as a reservoir host or even a susceptible host ", "answer_start": 1315}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which bat virus have been found to be linked with diseases?", "id": 3849, "answers": [{"text": "potential human infecting HKU-1, 4, 5 and 9 [17, 18] .

[10] sequenced a bat-derived influenza virus genome by using NGS in 2012, raising a serious question as to whether or not our seasonal or pandemic flu might have another reservoir host. Chen and colleagues [11] confirmed the SFTSV independently by using NGS. Indeed, metagenomics analysis has yielded a great deal of new viruses, especially from the environment. Our actively hunting for new viruses has made some significant contributions for our understanding of virus ecology, pathogenesis and interspecies transmission.\n\nScience China Life Sciences has focused on this hot topic in the event of the H7N9 outbreak after a comprehensive overview of the topic addressing HPAIV H5N1 in 2009 in the journal [12] [13] [14] . In this issue, six groups have been invited to present their recent findings on the emerging viruses, in addition to a previous report on H7N9 [3] .\n\nShi [15] reviewed recent discoveries of new viruses or virus genomes from bat. Bat is believed to harbor many more viruses than we ever thought as a reservoir host or even a susceptible host [16] . After the SARS-CoV virus, we have been actively seeking for new coronaviruses from bat and have yielded many of them, including potential human infecting HKU-1, 4, 5 and 9 [17, 18] . Recent MERS-CoV infection is another example for severe disease caused by used-to-be-less pathogenic coronaviruses. Shi and colleagues [19] by using NGS have discovered many unknown animal viruses from bat, especially some important paramyxoviruses and reoviruses. Filovirus has also been identified in bat with potential severe outcomes. Lyssaviruses (with many genotypes, including rabies virus) in the Rhabdoviridae family have been linked with severe fatal human cases, even in the developed countries, including Australia, with the bites of bats in the city [20, 21] . The potential roles of these viruses in bats for interspecies transmission are yet to be elucidated.\n\nTan and colleagues [22] specifically focused on the newly-emerged MERS-CoV. The virus was identified in 2012 in the Middle East with some exported cases to Europe. In 2013 the virus has been re-emerging and expanding its borders to more European countries. In the initial diagnosis, the pan-coronavirus real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay played a very important role for the identification of the causative agents. By using this method, scientists detected an expected-size PCR fragment for the corresponding conserved region of ORF1b of the replicase gene of a coronavirus. This is another example that molecular biology methods played for the discovery of new pathogens. Soon the receptor used by MERS-CoV to enter the host cells was identified [23] and the molecular basis of the receptor binding to the virus was also elucidated recently [8] .\n\nEnterovirus has been known as serious human pathogens for a long time but their significance to the public health has been emphasized by the emergence of enterovirus 71 in 1998 as a serious pathogenic agents for children in Taiwan [24] and re-emerged in mainland China in 2008 [25] . In this issue, Duan and colleagues [26] summarized the findings of new enteroviruses by using NGS. Because of the application of new NGS technology they also challenged the Koch's postulates. A new model of Koch's postulates, named the metagenomic Koch's postulates, has provided guidance for the study of the pathogenicity of novel viruses. The review also provided a detailed description of the NGS and related molecular methods for the virus discovery followed by a list of new enteroviruses found in human feces. These include viruses in the family of Piconaviridae, Parvoviridae, Circoviridae, Astroviridae and Polyomaviridae.\n\nYu Xue-Jie and colleagues [27] reviewed the new bunyavirus, SFTSV, identified in China. As the virus discoverers, they have overviewed the whole process of the discovery, which is helpful and meaningful for the new virus discoveries in the future. The disease caused by SFTSV, with a CFR of 12%, had been in China for a couple of years before the causative agent was finally identified. There are still a lot of questions remained unknown for this new virus and vigorous studies are in great need. The transmission route of the virus has not been clarified but tick as vector is suspected. Domestic and wild animals, e.g., goats, boars, cattle and dogs, are believed to be the virus-amplifying hosts. Therefore the effective control measures are still under evaluation. Vaccines protecting the SFTSV infection are under its way in Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Recently a similar virus has been identified in both Japan and USA (a new name of Heartland virus was proposed for the US virus) [9] .\n\nIn addition to new viruses infecting human beings, some new viruses infecting animals but their public health significance needing to be further evaluated, have also been discovered. The new flavivirus, duck egg-drop syndrome virus (DEDSV), is a good example. Su and colleagues [28] reviewed the characterization of the DEDSV and its disease form in this issue. The virus was found closely-related to a long-time-known virus, Tembusu virus [29, 30] . Initially, the disease was only found in egg-raising ducks but soon it was found in pigeons, chickens and geese [31, 32] . Yet the transmission vector, though mosquitoes are suspected, has not been identified. Due to the public health concerns of its related viruses, potential human infection of DEDSV should be evaluated.\n\nResearch on insect viruses is reviving in recent years. In this issue, Zhou and colleagues [33] reviewed the newly-identified insect viruses in China. Insects are the largest group of animals on the Earth therefore they also carry many more viruses. Studies on these viruses can provide useful knowledge for our understanding about animal or human infecting viruses.

Taubenberger\" and David M. Morens1-\n\nThe \u201cSpanish\" influenza pandemic of 1918\u20141919,\nwhich caused :50 million deaths worldwide, remains an\nominous warning to public health. Many questions about its\norigins, its unusual epidemiologic features, and the basis of\nits pathogenicity remain unanswered. The public health\nimplications of the pandemic therefore remain in doubt\neven as we now grapple with the feared emergence of a\npandemic caused by H5N1 or other virus. However, new\ninformation about the 1918 virus is emerging, for example,\nsequencing of the entire genome from archival autopsy tis-\nsues. But, the viral genome alone is unlikely to provide\nanswers to some critical questions. Understanding the\n1918 pandemic and its implications for future pandemics\nrequires careful experimentation and in-depth historical\nanalysis.\n\n \n\n\u201dCuriouser and curiouser/ \u201d criedAlice\nLewis Carroll, Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, 1865\n\nAn estimated one third of the world\u2019s population (or\nz500 million persons) were infected and had clinical-\nly apparent illnesses (1,2) during the 191871919 in\ufb02uenza\npandemic. The disease was exceptionally severe. Case-\nfatality rates were >2.5%, compared to <0.1% in other\nin\ufb02uenza pandemics (3,4). Total deaths were estimated at\nz50 million (577) and were arguably as high as 100 mil-\nlion (7).\n\nThe impact of this pandemic was not limited to\n191871919. All in\ufb02uenza A pandemics since that time, and\nindeed almost all cases of in\ufb02uenza A worldwide (except-\ning human infections from avian Viruses such as H5N1 and\nH7N7), have been caused by descendants of the 1918\nVirus, including \u201cdrifted\u201d H1N1 Viruses and reassorted\nH2N2 and H3N2 Viruses. The latter are composed of key\ngenes from the 1918 Virus, updated by subsequently-incor\u2014\nporated avian in\ufb02uenza genes that code for novel surface\n\n \n\n*Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rockville, Maryland, USA;\nand TNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA\n\nproteins, making the 1918 Virus indeed the \u201cmother\u201d of all\npandemics.\n\nIn 1918, the cause of human in\ufb02uenza and its links to\navian and swine in\ufb02uenza were unknown. Despite clinical\nand epidemiologic similarities to in\ufb02uenza pandemics of\n1889, 1847, and even earlier, many questioned whether\nsuch an explosively fatal disease could be in\ufb02uenza at all.\nThat question did not begin to be resolved until the 1930s,\nwhen closely related in\ufb02uenza Viruses (now known to be\nH1N1 Viruses) were isolated, \ufb01rst from pigs and shortly\nthereafter from humans. Seroepidemiologic studies soon\nlinked both of these viruses to the 1918 pandemic (8).\nSubsequent research indicates that descendants of the 1918\nVirus still persists enzootically in pigs. They probably also\ncirculated continuously in humans, undergoing gradual\nantigenic drift and causing annual epidemics, until the\n1950s. With the appearance of a new H2N2 pandemic\nstrain in 1957 (\u201cAsian \ufb02u\u201d), the direct H1N1 Viral descen-\ndants 0f the 1918 pandemic strain disappeared from human\ncirculation entirely, although the related lineage persisted\nenzootically in pigs. But in 1977, human H1N1 Viruses\nsuddenly \u201creemerged\u201d from a laboratory freezer (9). They\ncontinue to circulate endemically and epidemically.\n\nThus in 2006, 2 major descendant lineages of the 1918\nH1N1 Virus, as well as 2 additional reassortant lineages,\npersist naturally: a human epidemic/endemic H1N1 line-\nage, a porcine enzootic H1N1 lineage (so-called classic\nswine \ufb02u), and the reassorted human H3N2 Virus lineage,\nwhich like the human H1N1 Virus, has led to a porcine\nH3N2 lineage. None of these Viral descendants, however,\napproaches the pathogenicity of the 1918 parent Virus.\nApparently, the porcine H1N1 and H3N2 lineages uncom-\nmonly infect humans, and the human H1N1 and H3N2 lin-\neages have both been associated with substantially lower\nrates ofillness and death than the virus of 1918. In fact, cur-\nrent H1N1 death rates are even lower than those for H3N2\nlineage strains (prevalent from 1968 until the present).\nH1N1 Viruses descended from the 1918 strain, as well as \nH3N2 Viruses, have now been cocirculating worldwide for\n29 years and show little evidence of imminent extinction.\n\nTrying To Understand What Happened\n\nBy the early 1990s, 75 years of research had failed to\nanswer a most basic question about the 1918 pandemic:\nwhy was it so fatal? No Virus from 1918 had been isolated,\nbut all of its apparent descendants caused substantially\nmilder human disease. Moreover, examination of mortality\ndata from the 1920s suggests that within a few years after\n1918, in\ufb02uenza epidemics had settled into a pattern of\nannual epidemicity associated with strain drifting and sub-\nstantially lowered death rates. Did some critical Viral genet-\nic event produce a 1918 Virus of remarkable pathogenicity\nand then another critical genetic event occur soon after the\n1918 pandemic to produce an attenuated H1N1 Virus?\n\nIn 1995, a scienti\ufb01c team identi\ufb01ed archival in\ufb02uenza\nautopsy materials collected in the autumn of 1918 and\nbegan the slow process of sequencing small Viral RNA\nfragments to determine the genomic structure of the\ncausative in\ufb02uenza Virus (10). These efforts have now\ndetermined the complete genomic sequence of 1 Virus and\npartial sequences from 4 others. The primary data from the\nabove studies (11717) and a number of reviews covering\ndifferent aspects of the 1918 pandemic have recently been\npublished ([8720) and con\ufb01rm that the 1918 Virus is the\nlikely ancestor of all 4 of the human and swine H1N1 and\nH3N2 lineages, as well as the \u201cextinct\u201d H2N2 lineage. No\nknown mutations correlated with high pathogenicity in\nother human or animal in\ufb02uenza Viruses have been found\nin the 1918 genome, but ongoing studies to map Virulence\nfactors are yielding interesting results. The 1918 sequence\ndata, however, leave unanswered questions about the ori-\ngin of the Virus (19) and about the epidemiology of the\npandemic.\n\nWhen and Where Did the 1918 In\ufb02uenza\nPandemic Arise?\n\nBefore and after 1918, most in\ufb02uenza pandemics\ndeveloped in Asia and spread from there to the rest of the\nworld. Confounding de\ufb01nite assignment of a geographic\npoint of origin, the 1918 pandemic spread more or less\nsimultaneously in 3 distinct waves during an z12-month\nperiod in 191871919, in Europe, Asia, and North America\n(the \ufb01rst wave was best described in the United States in\nMarch 1918). Historical and epidemiologic data are inade-\nquate to identify the geographic origin of the Virus (21),\nand recent phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 Viral genome\ndoes not place the Virus in any geographic context ([9).\n\nAlthough in 1918 in\ufb02uenza was not a nationally\nreportable disease and diagnostic criteria for in\ufb02uenza and\npneumonia were vague, death rates from in\ufb02uenza and\npneumonia in the United States had risen sharply in 1915\nand 1916 because of a major respiratory disease epidemic\nbeginning in December 1915 (22). Death rates then dipped\nslightly in 1917. The \ufb01rst pandemic in\ufb02uenza wave\nappeared in the spring of 1918, followed in rapid succes-\nsion by much more fatal second and third waves in the fall\nand winter of 191871919, respectively (Figure 1). Is it pos-\nsible that a poorly-adapted H1N1 Virus was already begin-\nning to spread in 1915, causing some serious illnesses but\nnot yet suf\ufb01ciently \ufb01t to initiate a pandemic? Data consis-\ntent with this possibility were reported at the time from\nEuropean military camps (23), but a counter argument is\nthat if a strain with a new hemagglutinin (HA) was caus-\ning enough illness to affect the US national death rates\nfrom pneumonia and in\ufb02uenza, it should have caused a\npandemic sooner, and when it eventually did, in 1918,\nmany people should have been immune or at least partial-\nly immunoprotected. \u201cHerald\u201d events in 1915, 1916, and\npossibly even in early 1918, if they occurred, would be dif-\n\ufb01cult to identify.\n\nThe 1918 in\ufb02uenza pandemic had another unique fea-\nture, the simultaneous (or nearly simultaneous) infection\nof humans and swine. The Virus of the 1918 pandemic like-\nly expressed an antigenically novel subtype to which most\nhumans and swine were immunologically naive in 1918\n(12,20). Recently published sequence and phylogenetic\nanalyses suggest that the genes encoding the HA and neu-\nraminidase (NA) surface proteins of the 1918 Virus were\nderived from an avianlike in\ufb02uenza Virus shortly before\nthe start of the pandemic and that the precursor Virus had\nnot circulated widely in humans or swine in the few\ndecades before (12,15, 24). More recent analyses of the\nother gene segments of the Virus also support this conclu-\nsion. Regression analyses of human and swine in\ufb02uenza\nsequences obtained from 1930 to the present place the ini-\ntial circulation of the 1918 precursor Virus in humans at\napproximately 191571918 (20). Thus, the precursor was\nprobably not circulating widely in humans until shortly\nbefore 1918, nor did it appear to have jumped directly\nfrom any species of bird studied to date (19). In summary,\nits origin remains puzzling.\n\nWere the 3 Waves in 1918\u20141 919 Caused\nby the Same Virus? If So, How and Why?\nHistorical records since the 16th century suggest that\nnew in\ufb02uenza pandemics may appear at any time of year,\nnot necessarily in the familiar annual winter patterns of\ninterpandemic years, presumably because newly shifted\nin\ufb02uenza Viruses behave differently when they \ufb01nd a uni-\nversal or highly susceptible human population. Thereafter,\nconfronted by the selection pressures of population immu-\nnity, these pandemic Viruses begin to drift genetically and\neventually settle into a pattern of annual epidemic recur-\nrences caused by the drifted Virus variants.\n\nFigure 1. Three pandemic waves: weekly combined in\ufb02uenza and\npneumonia mortality, United Kingdom, 1918\u20141919 (21).\n\nIn the 1918-1919 pandemic, a \ufb01rst or spring wave\nbegan in March 1918 and spread unevenly through the\nUnited States, Europe, and possibly Asia over the next 6\nmonths (Figure 1). Illness rates were high, but death rates\nin most locales were not appreciably above normal. A sec-\nond or fall wave spread globally from September to\nNovember 1918 and was highly fatal. In many nations, a\nthird wave occurred in early 1919 (21). Clinical similari-\nties led contemporary observers to conclude initially that\nthey were observing the same disease in the successive\nwaves. The milder forms of illness in all 3 waves were\nidentical and typical of in\ufb02uenza seen in the 1889 pandem-\nic and in prior interpandemic years. In retrospect, even the\nrapid progressions from uncomplicated in\ufb02uenza infec-\ntions to fatal pneumonia, a hallmark of the 191871919 fall\nand winter waves, had been noted in the relatively few\nsevere spring wave cases. The differences between the\nwaves thus seemed to be primarily in the much higher fre-\nquency of complicated, severe, and fatal cases in the last 2\nwaves.\n\nBut 3 extensive pandemic waves of in\ufb02uenza within 1\nyear, occurring in rapid succession, with only the briefest\nof quiescent intervals between them, was unprecedented.\nThe occurrence, and to some extent the severity, of recur-\nrent annual outbreaks, are driven by Viral antigenic drift,\nwith an antigenic variant Virus emerging to become domi-\nnant approximately every 2 to 3 years. Without such drift,\ncirculating human in\ufb02uenza Viruses would presumably\ndisappear once herd immunity had reached a critical\nthreshold at which further Virus spread was suf\ufb01ciently\nlimited. The timing and spacing of in\ufb02uenza epidemics in\ninterpandemic years have been subjects of speculation for\ndecades. Factors believed to be responsible include partial\nherd immunity limiting Virus spread in all but the most\nfavorable circumstances, which include lower environ-\nmental temperatures and human nasal temperatures (bene-\n\ufb01cial to thermolabile Viruses such as in\ufb02uenza), optimal\nhumidity, increased crowding indoors, and imperfect ven-\ntilation due to closed windows and suboptimal air\ufb02ow.\n\nHowever, such factors cannot explain the 3 pandemic\nwaves of 1918-1919, which occurred in the spring-sum-\nmer, summer\u2014fall, and winter (of the Northern\nHemisphere), respectively. The \ufb01rst 2 waves occurred at a\ntime of year normally unfavorable to in\ufb02uenza Virus\nspread. The second wave caused simultaneous outbreaks\nin the Northern and Southern Hemispheres from\nSeptember to November. Furthermore, the interwave peri-\nods were so brief as to be almost undetectable in some\nlocales. Reconciling epidemiologically the steep drop in\ncases in the \ufb01rst and second waves with the sharp rises in\ncases of the second and third waves is dif\ufb01cult. Assuming\neven transient postinfection immunity, how could suscep-\ntible persons be too few to sustain transmission at 1 point,\nand yet enough to start a new explosive pandemic wave a\nfew weeks later? Could the Virus have mutated profoundly\nand almost simultaneously around the world, in the short\nperiods between the successive waves? Acquiring Viral\ndrift suf\ufb01cient to produce new in\ufb02uenza strains capable of\nescaping population immunity is believed to take years of\nglobal circulation, not weeks of local circulation. And hav-\ning occurred, such mutated Viruses normally take months\nto spread around the world.\n\nAt the beginning of other \u201coff season\u201d in\ufb02uenza pan-\ndemics, successive distinct waves within a year have not\nbeen reported. The 1889 pandemic, for example, began in\nthe late spring of 1889 and took several months to spread\nthroughout the world, peaking in northern Europe and the\nUnited States late in 1889 or early in 1890. The second\nrecurrence peaked in late spring 1891 (more than a year\nafter the \ufb01rst pandemic appearance) and the third in early\n1892 (21 ). As was true for the 1918 pandemic, the second\n1891 recurrence produced of the most deaths. The 3 recur-\nrences in 1889-1892, however, were spread over >3 years,\nin contrast to 191871919, when the sequential waves seen\nin individual countries were typically compressed into\nz879 months.\n\nWhat gave the 1918 Virus the unprecedented ability to\ngenerate rapidly successive pandemic waves is unclear.\nBecause the only 1918 pandemic Virus samples we have\nyet identi\ufb01ed are from second-wave patients ([6), nothing\ncan yet be said about whether the \ufb01rst (spring) wave, or for\nthat matter, the third wave, represented circulation of the\nsame Virus or variants of it. Data from 1918 suggest that\npersons infected in the second wave may have been pro-\ntected from in\ufb02uenza in the third wave. But the few data\nbearing on protection during the second and third waves\nafter infection in the \ufb01rst wave are inconclusive and do lit-\ntle to resolve the question of whether the \ufb01rst wave was\ncaused by the same Virus or whether major genetic evolu-\ntionary events were occurring even as the pandemic\nexploded and progressed. Only in\ufb02uenza RNAipositive\nhuman samples from before 1918, and from all 3 waves,\ncan answer this question.\n\nWhat Was the Animal Host\nOrigin of the Pandemic Virus?\n\nViral sequence data now suggest that the entire 1918\nVirus was novel to humans in, or shortly before, 1918, and\nthat it thus was not a reassortant Virus produced from old\nexisting strains that acquired 1 or more new genes, such as\nthose causing the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. On the con-\ntrary, the 1918 Virus appears to be an avianlike in\ufb02uenza\nVirus derived in toto from an unknown source (17,19), as\nits 8 genome segments are substantially different from\ncontemporary avian in\ufb02uenza genes. In\ufb02uenza Virus gene\nsequences from a number of\ufb01xed specimens ofwild birds\ncollected circa 1918 show little difference from avian\nViruses isolated today, indicating that avian Viruses likely\nundergo little antigenic change in their natural hosts even\nover long periods (24,25).\n\nFor example, the 1918 nucleoprotein (NP) gene\nsequence is similar to that ofviruses found in wild birds at\nthe amino acid level but very divergent at the nucleotide\nlevel, which suggests considerable evolutionary distance\nbetween the sources of the 1918 NP and of currently\nsequenced NP genes in wild bird strains (13,19). One way\nof looking at the evolutionary distance of genes is to com-\npare ratios of synonymous to nonsynonymous nucleotide\nsubstitutions. A synonymous substitution represents a\nsilent change, a nucleotide change in a codon that does not\nresult in an amino acid replacement. A nonsynonymous\nsubstitution is a nucleotide change in a codon that results\nin an amino acid replacement. Generally, a Viral gene sub-\njected to immunologic drift pressure or adapting to a new\nhost exhibits a greater percentage of nonsynonymous\nmutations, while a Virus under little selective pressure\naccumulates mainly synonymous changes. Since little or\nno selection pressure is exerted on synonymous changes,\nthey are thought to re\ufb02ect evolutionary distance.\n\nBecause the 1918 gene segments have more synony-\nmous changes from known sequences of wild bird strains\nthan expected, they are unlikely to have emerged directly\nfrom an avian in\ufb02uenza Virus similar to those that have\nbeen sequenced so far. This is especially apparent when\none examines the differences at 4-fold degenerate codons,\nthe subset of synonymous changes in which, at the third\ncodon position, any of the 4 possible nucleotides can be\nsubstituted without changing the resulting amino acid. At\nthe same time, the 1918 sequences have too few amino acid\ndi\ufb01erences from those of wild-bird strains to have spent\nmany years adapting only in a human or swine intermedi-\nate host. One possible explanation is that these unusual\ngene segments were acquired from a reservoir of in\ufb02uenza\nVirus that has not yet been identi\ufb01ed or sampled. All of\nthese \ufb01ndings beg the question: where did the 1918 Virus\ncome from?\n\nIn contrast to the genetic makeup of the 1918 pandem-\nic Virus, the novel gene segments of the reassorted 1957\nand 1968 pandemic Viruses all originated in Eurasian avian\nViruses (26); both human Viruses arose by the same mech-\nanismireassortment of a Eurasian wild waterfowl strain\nwith the previously circulating human H1N1 strain.\nProving the hypothesis that the Virus responsible for the\n1918 pandemic had a markedly different origin requires\nsamples of human in\ufb02uenza strains circulating before\n1918 and samples of in\ufb02uenza strains in the wild that more\nclosely resemble the 1918 sequences.\n\nWhat Was the Biological Basis for\n1918 Pandemic Virus Pathogenicity?\n\nSequence analysis alone does not o\ufb01er clues to the\npathogenicity of the 1918 Virus. A series of experiments\nare under way to model Virulence in Vitro and in animal\nmodels by using Viral constructs containing 1918 genes\nproduced by reverse genetics.\n\nIn\ufb02uenza Virus infection requires binding of the HA\nprotein to sialic acid receptors on host cell surface. The HA\nreceptor-binding site con\ufb01guration is different for those\nin\ufb02uenza Viruses adapted to infect birds and those adapted\nto infect humans. In\ufb02uenza Virus strains adapted to birds\npreferentially bind sialic acid receptors with 01 (273) linked\nsugars (27729). Human-adapted in\ufb02uenza Viruses are\nthought to preferentially bind receptors with 01 (2%) link-\nages. The switch from this avian receptor con\ufb01guration\nrequires of the Virus only 1 amino acid change (30), and\nthe HAs of all 5 sequenced 1918 Viruses have this change,\nwhich suggests that it could be a critical step in human host\nadaptation. A second change that greatly augments Virus\nbinding to the human receptor may also occur, but only 3\nof5 1918 HA sequences have it (16).\n\nThis means that at least 2 H1N1 receptor-binding vari-\nants cocirculated in 1918: 1 with high\u2014af\ufb01nity binding to\nthe human receptor and 1 with mixed-af\ufb01nity binding to\nboth avian and human receptors. No geographic or chrono-\nlogic indication eXists to suggest that one of these variants\nwas the precursor of the other, nor are there consistent dif-\nferences between the case histories or histopathologic fea-\ntures of the 5 patients infected with them. Whether the\nViruses were equally transmissible in 1918, whether they\nhad identical patterns of replication in the respiratory tree,\nand whether one or both also circulated in the \ufb01rst and\nthird pandemic waves, are unknown.\nIn a series of in Vivo experiments, recombinant in\ufb02uen-\nza Viruses containing between 1 and 5 gene segments of\nthe 1918 Virus have been produced. Those constructs\nbearing the 1918 HA and NA are all highly pathogenic in\n\nmice (31). Furthermore, expression microarray analysis\nperformed on whole lung tissue of mice infected with the\n1918 HA/NA recombinant showed increased upregulation\nof genes involved in apoptosis, tissue injury, and oxidative\ndamage (32). These \ufb01ndings are unexpected because the\nViruses with the 1918 genes had not been adapted to mice;\ncontrol experiments in which mice were infected with\nmodern human Viruses showed little disease and limited\nViral replication. The lungs of animals infected with the\n1918 HA/NA construct showed bronchial and alveolar\nepithelial necrosis and a marked in\ufb02ammatory in\ufb01ltrate,\nwhich suggests that the 1918 HA (and possibly the NA)\ncontain Virulence factors for mice. The Viral genotypic\nbasis of this pathogenicity is not yet mapped. Whether\npathogenicity in mice effectively models pathogenicity in\nhumans is unclear. The potential role of the other 1918 pro-\nteins, singularly and in combination, is also unknown.\nExperiments to map further the genetic basis of Virulence\nof the 1918 Virus in various animal models are planned.\nThese experiments may help de\ufb01ne the Viral component to\nthe unusual pathogenicity of the 1918 Virus but cannot\naddress whether speci\ufb01c host factors in 1918 accounted for\nunique in\ufb02uenza mortality patterns.\n\nWhy Did the 1918 Virus Kill So Many Healthy\nYoung Ad ults?\n\nThe curve of in\ufb02uenza deaths by age at death has histor-\nically, for at least 150 years, been U-shaped (Figure 2),\nexhibiting mortality peaks in the very young and the very\nold, with a comparatively low frequency of deaths at all\nages in between. In contrast, age-speci\ufb01c death rates in the\n1918 pandemic exhibited a distinct pattern that has not been\ndocumented before or since: a \u201cW\u2014shaped\u201d curve, similar to\nthe familiar U-shaped curve but with the addition of a third\n(middle) distinct peak of deaths in young adults z20410\nyears of age. In\ufb02uenza and pneumonia death rates for those\n1534 years of age in 191871919, for example, were\n20 times higher than in previous years (35). Overall, near-\nly half of the in\ufb02uenza\u2014related deaths in the 1918 pandem-\nic were in young adults 20410 years of age, a phenomenon\nunique to that pandemic year. The 1918 pandemic is also\nunique among in\ufb02uenza pandemics in that absolute risk of\nin\ufb02uenza death was higher in those <65 years of age than in\nthose >65; persons <65 years of age accounted for >99% of\nall excess in\ufb02uenza\u2014related deaths in 191871919. In com-\nparison, the <65-year age group accounted for 36% of all\nexcess in\ufb02uenza\u2014related deaths in the 1957 H2N2 pandem-\nic and 48% in the 1968 H3N2 pandemic (33).\nA sharper perspective emerges when 1918 age-speci\ufb01c\nin\ufb02uenza morbidity rates (21) are used to adj ust the W-\nshaped mortality curve (Figure 3, panels, A, B, and C\n[35,37]). Persons 65 years of age in 1918 had a dispro-\nportionately high in\ufb02uenza incidence (Figure 3, panel A).\n\nBut even after adjusting age-speci\ufb01c deaths by age-specif\u2014\nic clinical attack rates (Figure 3, panel B), a W\u2014shaped\ncurve with a case-fatality peak in young adults remains and\nis signi\ufb01cantly different from U-shaped age-speci\ufb01c case-\nfatality curves typically seen in other in\ufb02uenza years, e.g.,\n192871929 (Figure 3, panel C). Also, in 1918 those 5 to 14\nyears of age accounted for a disproportionate number of\nin\ufb02uenza cases, but had a much lower death rate from\nin\ufb02uenza and pneumonia than other age groups. To explain\nthis pattern, we must look beyond properties of the Virus to\nhost and environmental factors, possibly including\nimmunopathology (e.g., antibody-dependent infection\nenhancement associated with prior Virus exposures [38])\nand exposure to risk cofactors such as coinfecting agents,\nmedications, and environmental agents.\n\nOne theory that may partially explain these \ufb01ndings is\nthat the 1918 Virus had an intrinsically high Virulence, tem-\npered only in those patients who had been born before\n1889, e.g., because of exposure to a then-circulating Virus\ncapable of providing partial immunoprotection against the\n1918 Virus strain only in persons old enough (>35 years) to\nhave been infected during that prior era (35). But this the-\nory would present an additional paradox: an obscure pre-\ncursor Virus that left no detectable trace today would have\nhad to have appeared and disappeared before 1889 and\nthen reappeared more than 3 decades later.\n\nEpidemiologic data on rates of clinical in\ufb02uenza by\nage, collected between 1900 and 1918, provide good evi-\ndence for the emergence of an antigenically novel in\ufb02uen-\nza Virus in 1918 (21). Jordan showed that from 1900 to\n1917, the 5- to 15-year age group accounted for 11% of\ntotal in\ufb02uenza cases, while the >65-year age group\naccounted for 6 % of in\ufb02uenza cases. But in 1918, cases in\n\nFigure 2. \u201cU-\u201d and \u201cW\u2014\u201d shaped combined in\ufb02uenza and pneumo-\nnia mortality, by age at death, per 100,000 persons in each age\ngroup, United States, 1911\u20141918.

A more typical curve\nof age-specific influenza case-fatality (panel C, dotted line) is\ntaken from US Public Health Service surveys during 1928\u20141929\n(37).\n\nthe 5 to 15-year-old group jumped to 25% of in\ufb02uenza\ncases (compatible with exposure to an antigenically novel\nVirus strain), while the >65-year age group only accounted\nfor 0.6% of the in\ufb02uenza cases, \ufb01ndings consistent with\npreviously acquired protective immunity caused by an\nidentical or closely related Viral protein to which older per-\nsons had once been exposed. Mortality data are in accord.\nIn 1918, persons >75 years had lower in\ufb02uenza and\n\npneumonia case-fatality rates than they had during the\nprepandemic period of 191171917. At the other end of the\nage spectrum (Figure 2), a high proportion of deaths in\ninfancy and early childhood in 1918 mimics the age pat-\ntern, if not the mortality rate, of other in\ufb02uenza pandemics.\n\nCould a 1918-like Pandemic Appear Again?\nIf So, What Could We Do About It?\n\nIn its disease course and pathologic features, the 1918\npandemic was different in degree, but not in kind, from\nprevious and subsequent pandemics. Despite the extraordi-\nnary number of global deaths, most in\ufb02uenza cases in\n1918 (>95% in most locales in industrialized nations) were\nmild and essentially indistinguishable from in\ufb02uenza cases\ntoday. Furthermore, laboratory experiments with recombi-\nnant in\ufb02uenza Viruses containing genes from the 1918\nVirus suggest that the 1918 and 1918-like Viruses would be\nas sensitive as other typical Virus strains to the Food and\nDrug Administrationiapproved antiin\ufb02uenza drugs riman-\ntadine and oseltamivir.\n\nHowever, some characteristics of the 1918 pandemic\nappear unique: most notably, death rates were 5 7 20 times\nhigher than expected. Clinically and pathologically, these\nhigh death rates appear to be the result of several factors,\nincluding a higher proportion of severe and complicated\ninfections of the respiratory tract, rather than involvement\nof organ systems outside the normal range of the in\ufb02uenza\nVirus. Also, the deaths were concentrated in an unusually\nyoung age group. Finally, in 1918, 3 separate recurrences\nof in\ufb02uenza followed each other with unusual rapidity,\nresulting in 3 explosive pandemic waves within a year\u2019s\ntime (Figure 1). Each of these unique characteristics may\nre\ufb02ect genetic features of the 1918 Virus, but understand-\ning them will also require examination of host and envi-\nronmental factors.\n\nUntil we can ascertain which of these factors gave rise\nto the mortality patterns observed and learn more about the\nformation of the pandemic, predictions are only educated\nguesses. We can only conclude that since it happened once,\nanalogous conditions could lead to an equally devastating\npandemic.\n\nLike the 1918 Virus, H5N1 is an avian Virus (39),\nthough a distantly related one. The evolutionary path that\nled to pandemic emergence in 1918 is entirely unknown,\nbut it appears to be different in many respects from the cur-\nrent situation with H5N1. There are no historical data,\neither in 1918 or in any other pandemic, for establishing\nthat a pandemic \u201cprecursor\u201d Virus caused a highly patho-\ngenic outbreak in domestic poultry, and no highly patho-\ngenic avian in\ufb02uenza (HPAI) Virus, including H5N1 and a\nnumber of others, has ever been known to cause a major\nhuman epidemic, let alone a pandemic. While data bearing\non in\ufb02uenza Virus human cell adaptation (e.g., receptor\nbinding) are beginning to be understood at the molecular\nlevel, the basis for Viral adaptation to ef\ufb01cient human-to-\nhuman spread, the chief prerequisite for pandemic emer-\ngence, is unknown for any in\ufb02uenza Virus. The 1918 Virus\nacquired this trait, but we do not know how, and we cur-\nrently have no way of knowing whether H5N1 Viruses are\nnow in a parallel process of acquiring human-to-human\ntransmissibility. Despite an explosion of data on the 1918\nVirus during the past decade, we are not much closer to\nunderstanding pandemic emergence in 2006 than we were\nin understanding the risk of H1N1 \u201cswine \ufb02u\u201d emergence\nin 1976.\n\nEven with modern antiviral and antibacterial drugs,\nvaccines, and prevention knowledge, the return of a pan-\ndemic Virus equivalent in pathogenicity to the Virus of\n1918 would likely kill >100 million people worldwide. A\npandemic Virus with the (alleged) pathogenic potential of\nsome recent H5N1 outbreaks could cause substantially\nmore deaths.\n\nWhether because of Viral, host or environmental fac-\ntors, the 1918 Virus causing the \ufb01rst or \u2018spring\u2019 wave was\nnot associated with the exceptional pathogenicity of the\nsecond (fall) and third (winter) waves. Identi\ufb01cation of an\nin\ufb02uenza RNA-positive case from the \ufb01rst wave could\npoint to a genetic basis for Virulence by allowing differ-\nences in Viral sequences to be highlighted. Identi\ufb01cation of\npre-1918 human in\ufb02uenza RNA samples would help us\nunderstand the timing of emergence of the 1918 Virus.\nSurveillance and genomic sequencing of large numbers of\nanimal in\ufb02uenza Viruses will help us understand the genet-\nic basis of host adaptation and the extent of the natural\nreservoir of in\ufb02uenza Viruses. Understanding in\ufb02uenza\npandemics in general requires understanding the 1918 pan-\ndemic in all its historical, epidemiologic, and biologic\naspects.\n\nDr Taubenberger is chair of the Department of Molecular\nPathology at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rockville,\nMaryland.

The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0. Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403&minus;540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18&minus;25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average. We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49&minus;2.63). Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.\n\nText: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia infection, which is deadly [1] , was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [2] . The virus causes a range of symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath [3] . The cumulative number of reported cases slowly increased to cumulative 41 cases by 1 January 2020, and rapidly increased after 16 January 2020. As of 26 January 2020, the still ongoing outbreak had resulted in 2066 (618 of them are in Wuhan) confirmed cases and 56 (45 of them were in Wuhan) deaths in mainland China [4] , and sporadic cases exported from Wuhan were reported in Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, and the United States, please see the World Health Organization (WHO) news release via https://www.who.int/csr/don/en/ from 14 to 21 January 2020. Using the number of cases exported from Wuhan to other countries, a research group at Imperial College London estimated that there had been 4000 (95%CI: 1000-9700) cases in Wuhan with symptoms onset by 18 January 2020, and the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) was estimated at 2.6 (95%CI: 1.5-3.5) [5] . Leung et al. drew a similar conclusion and estimated the number of cases exported from Wuhan to other major cities in China [6] , and the potentials of travel related risks of disease spreading was also indicated by [7] .\n\nDue to an unknown reason, the cumulative number of cases remained at 41 from 1 to 15 January 2020 according to the official report, i.e., no new case was reported during these 15 days, which appears inconsistent with the following rapid growth of the epidemic curve since 16 January 2020. We suspect that the 2019-nCoV cases were under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020. In this study, we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R 0 , of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan from 1 to 15 January 2020 based on the limited data in the early outbreak.\n\nThe time series data of 2019-nCoV cases in mainland China were initially released by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission from 10 to 20 January 2020 [8] , and later by the National Health Commission of China after 21 January 2020 [9] . The case time series data in December 2019 were obtained from a published study [3] . All cases were laboratory confirmed following the case definition by the national health commission of China [10] . We chose the data up to 24 January 2020 instead of to the present study completion date. Given the lag between timings of case confirmation and news release of new cases, the data of the most recent few days were most likely to be tentative, and thus they were excluded from the analysis to be consistent.\n\nWe suspected that there was a number of cases, denoted by \u03be, under-reported from 1 to 15 January 2020. The cumulative total number of cases, denoted by C i , of the i-th day since 1 December 2019 is the summation of the cumulative reported, c i , and cumulative unreported cases, \u039e i . We have C i = c i + \u039e i , where c i is observed from the data, and \u039e i is 0 for i before 1 January and \u03be for i after 15 January 2020. Following previous studies [11, 12] , we modelled the epidemic curve, i.e., the C i series, as an exponential growing Poisson process. Since the data from 1 to 15 January 2020 appeared constant due to unclear reason(s), we removed these data from the fitting of exponential growth. The \u03be and the intrinsic growth rate (\u03b3) of the exponential growth were to be estimated based on the log-likelihood, denoted by , from the Poisson priors. The 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of \u03be was estimated by the profile likelihood estimation framework with cutoff threshold determined by a Chi-square quantile [13] , \u03c7 2 pr = 0.95, df = 1 . With \u03b3 estimated, the basic reproduction number could be obtained by R 0 = 1/M(\u2212\u03b3) with 100% susceptibility for 2019-nCoV presumed at this early stage. Here, the function M(\u00b7) was the Laplace transform, i.e., the moment generating function, of the probability distribution for the serial interval (SI) of the disease [11, 14] , denoted by h(k) and k is the mean SI. Since the transmission chain of 2019-nCoV remained unclear, we adopted the SI information from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which share the similar pathogen as 2019-nCoV [15] [16] [17] . We modelled h(k) as Gamma distributions with mean of 8.0 days and standard deviation (SD) of 3.6 days by averaging the SI mean and SD of SARS, mean of 7.6 days and SD of 3.4 days [18] , and MERS, mean of 8.4 days and SD of 3.8 days [19] .\n\nWe were also interested in inferring the patterns of the daily number of cases, denoted by \u03b5 i for the i-th day, and thus it is obviously that C i = C i\u22121 + \u03b5 i . A simulation framework was developed for the iterative Poisson process such that E[\n\ndenoted the expectation. The simulation was implemented starting from 1 January 2020 with a cumulative number of cases seed of 40, the same as reported on 31 December 2019. We conducted 1000 samples and calculated the median and 95% CI.\n\nThe number of 2019-nCoV unreported cases was estimated at 469 (95% CI: 403-540), see Figure 1a , which was significantly larger than 0. This finding implied the occurrence of under-reporting between 1 and 15 January 2020. After accounting for the effect of under-reporting, the R 0 was estimated at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49-2.63), see Figure 1b , which is consistent with many existing online preprints with range from 2 to 4 [5, [20] [21] [22] . With the R 0 of 2.56 and \u03be of 469, the exponential growing framework fitted the cumulative total number of cases (C i ) remarkably well, see Figure 1c iterative Poisson process such that\n\ndenoted the expectation. The simulation was implemented starting from 1 January 2020 with a cumulative number of cases seed of 40, the same as reported on 31 December 2019. We conducted 1000 samples and calculated the median and 95% CI.\n\nThe number of 2019-nCoV unreported cases was estimated at 469 (95% CI: 403\u2212540), see Figure  1a , which was significantly larger than 0. This finding implied the occurrence of under-reporting between 1 and 15 January 2020.

With the R0 of 2.56 and \u03be of 469, the exponential growing framework fitted the cumulative total number of cases (Ci) remarkably well, see Figure 1c , referring to McFadden's pseudo-R-squared of 0.99. show the exponential growth fitting results of the cumulative number of cases (Ci) and the daily number of cases (\u03b5i) respectively. In panels (c) and (d), the gold squares are the reported cases, the blue bold curve represents the median of the fitting results, the dashed blue curves are the 95% CI of the fitting results, and the purple shading area represents the time window from 1 to 15 January 2020. In panel (c), the blue dots are the cumulative total, i.e., reported and unreported, number of cases. In panel (d), the grey curves are the 1000 simulation samples.\n\nOur estimation of R0 rely on the SI of 2019-nCoV, which remains unknown as of 26 January 2020. In this work, we employed the SIs of SARS and MERS as approximations to that of 2019-nCoV. The determination of SI requires the knowledge of the chain of disease transmission that needs a sufficient number of patient samples and periods of time for follow-up [23] , and thus this is unlikely to be achieved shortly. However, using SIs of SARS and MERS as approximation could provide an panels (a,b) , the green shading area represents the 95% CI (on the horizontal axis), and the vertical green line represents the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the number of unreported cases. With the MLE of R 0 at 2.56, panels (c,d) show the exponential growth fitting results of the cumulative number of cases (C i ) and the daily number of cases (\u03b5 i ) respectively. In panels (c,d), the gold squares are the reported cases, the blue bold curve represents the median of the fitting results, the dashed blue curves are the 95% CI of the fitting results, and the purple shading area represents the time window from 1 to 15 January 2020.

However, using SIs of SARS and MERS as approximation could provide an insight into the transmission potential of 2019-nCoV at the early outbreak. We note that slightly varying the mean and SD of SI would not affect our main conclusions. The R 0 of 2019-nCoV was estimated at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49-2.63), and it is generally in line with those of SARS, i.e., 2-5 [19, 24, 25] , and MERS, i.e., 2.7-3.9 [26] .\n\nFor the simulated daily number of cases (\u03b5 i ), see Figure 1d , we found that \u03b5 i matched the observed daily number after 17 January 2020, but was significantly larger than the observations from 1 to 17 January 2020. This finding implied that under-reporting was likely to have occurred in the first half of January 2020. We estimated that the reporting rate after 17 January 2020 increased 21-fold (95% CI: [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] compared to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average. One of the possible reasons was that the official diagnostic protocol was released by WHO on 17 January 2020 [27] , and the diagnosis and reporting efforts of 2019-nCoV infections probably increased. Thereafter, the daily number of newly reported cases started increasing rapidly after 17 January 2020, see Figure 1d . We conducted additional sensitivity analysis by varying the starting date of the under-reporting time window, e.g., 1 January 2020 in the main results, from 2 December 2019 to 3 January 2020, and we report our estimates largely hold. The exact value of the reporting rate was difficult to determine due to lack of serological surveillance data. The reporting rate can be determined if serological surveillance data are available for a population; we would know who was infected (seropositive) and who was not (seronegative), with high confidence. The reporting rate is the ratio of reported cases over the number of seropositive individuals. It was statistically evident that increasing in reporting was likely, and thus it should be considered in the future investigation of this outbreak.\n\nPrevious preprint suggested cumulative cases of 1723 (95% CI: 427-4471) as of 12 January 2020, and 4000 (95% CI: 1000-9700) as of 18 January 2020 based on the aggregated international export cases [5] . Our analysis yielded cumulative cases of 280 (95% CI: 128-613) as of 12 January 2020, and 609 (95% CI: 278-1333) as of 18 January 2020 based on the exponential growing mechanistic in the early outbreak. Although our estimate case number appeared to have a lower mean than those estimated by Imai et al. [5] , they are not statistically different. This study applied a different screening effort to detect the 2019-nCoV cases from that in Imai et al. [5] . Imai et al. assumed the average screening effort at overseas airports that covered travelers arriving from Wuhan. Whereas we assumed a constant screening effort applied in Wuhan at the same point of time, and then a number of cases (i.e., \u03be) should have been reported yet failed to be reported in the first half of January 2020 due to all sorts of reasons. It is not surprising that different assumptions yielded different results, and this difference in screening effort also partly explained why the detected cases out of China mainly presented mild symptoms. Thus, it was reasonable that our estimates appeared lower than those estimated by Imai et al. [5] . It must be emphasized that such a gap in the knowledge would be resolved by serological survey study (for a large population to approximate the actual positive rate) or an explicit estimation of the actual reporting rate.\n\nUnder-reporting was likely to have occurred and resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403-540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18-25) compared with the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average, and it should be considered in future investigation. We estimated the R 0 at 2019-nCoV to be 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49-2.63).\n\nAuthor Contributions: All authors conceived the study, carried out the analysis, discussed the results, drafted the first manuscript.

Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization. We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike\u2019s receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.\n\nText: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronavirdiae, order Nidovirales. There are four genera of CoVs, namely, Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1CoV), Betacoronavirus (\u03b2CoV), Deltacoronavirus (\u03b4CoV), and Gammacoronavirus (\u03b3CoV) [1] . Evolutionary analyses have shown that bats and rodents are the gene sources of most \u03b1CoVs and \u03b2CoVs, while avian species are the gene sources of most \u03b4CoVs and \u03b3CoVs. CoVs have repeatedly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens. The best-known examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) which emerged in China in 2002-2003 to cause a large-scale epidemic with about 8000 infections and 800 deaths, and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) which has caused a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012 [2, 3] . In both of these epidemics, these viruses have likely originated from bats and then jumped into another amplification mammalian host [the Himalayan palm civet (Paguma larvata) for SARS-CoV and the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) for MERS-CoV] before crossing species barriers to infect humans.\n\nPrior to December 2019, 6 CoVs were known to infect human, including 2 \u03b1CoV (HCoV-229E and HKU-NL63) and 4 \u03b2CoV (HCoV-OC43 [ \n\nHCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause self-limiting upper respiratory infections in immunocompetent hosts and occasionally lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts and elderly [4] . In contrast, SARS-CoV (lineage B \u03b2CoV) and MERS-CoV (lineage C \u03b2CoV) may cause severe lower respiratory tract infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome and extrapulmonary manifestations, such as diarrhea, lymphopenia, deranged liver and renal function tests, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, among both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts with mortality rates of \u223c10% and \u223c35%, respectively [5, 6] . On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China [7] . Subsequent virological testing showed that a novel CoV was detected in these patients. As of 16 January 2020, 43 patients have been diagnosed to have infection with this novel CoV, including two exported cases of mild pneumonia in Thailand and Japan [8, 9] . The earliest date of symptom onset was 1 December 2019 [10] . The symptomatology of these patients included fever, malaise, dry cough, and dyspnea. Among 41 patients admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan, 13 (32%) required intensive care and 6 (15%) died. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest computerized tomography scans [10] . We recently reported a familial cluster of 2019-nCoV infection in a Shenzhen family with travel history to Wuhan [11] . In the present study, we analyzed a 2019-nCoV complete genome from a patient in this familial cluster and compared it with the genomes of related \u03b2CoVs to provide insights into the potential source and control strategies.\n\nThe complete genome sequence of 2019-nCoV HKU-SZ-005b was available at GenBank (accession no. MN975262) ( Table 1 ). The representative complete genomes of other related \u03b2CoVs strains collected from human or mammals were included for comparative analysis. These included strains collected from human, bats, and Himalayan palm civet between 2003 and 2018, with one 229E coronavirus strain as the outgroup.\n\nPhylogenetic tree construction by the neighbour joining method was performed using MEGA X software, with bootstrap values being calculated from 1000 trees [12] . The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) was shown next to the branches [13] . The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method and were in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site [14] . All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [15] . Multiple alignment was performed using CLUSTAL 2.1 and further visualized using BOX-SHADE 3.21. Structural analysis of orf8 was performed using PSI-blast-based secondary structure PREDiction (PSIPRED) [16] . For the prediction of protein secondary structure including beta sheet, alpha helix, and coil, initial amino acid sequences were input and analysed using neural networking and its own algorithm. Predicted structures were visualized and highlighted on the BOX-SHADE alignment. Prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using the TMHMM 2.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Secondary structure prediction in the 5 \u2032 -untranslated region (UTR) and 3 \u2032 -UTR was performed using the RNAfold WebServer (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/ RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi) with minimum free energy (MFE) and partition function in Fold algorithms and Table 2 .

The human SARS-CoV 5 \u2032 -and 3 \u2032 -UTR were used as references to adjust the prediction results.\n\nThe single-stranded RNA genome of the 2019-nCoV was 29891 nucleotides in size, encoding 9860 amino acids. The G + C content was 38%. Similar to other (Table 2 ). There are no remarkable differences between the orfs and nsps of 2019-nCoV with those of SARS-CoV (Table 3) . The major distinction between SARSr-CoV and SARS-CoV is in orf3b, Spike and orf8 but especially variable in Spike S1 and orf8 which were previously shown to be recombination hot spots.\n\nSpike glycoprotein comprised of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains a signal peptide, followed by an N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit contains conserved fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2, transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain (CP). We found that the S2 subunit of 2019-nCoV is highly conserved and shares 99% identity with those of the two bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45) and human SARS-CoV (Figure 2 ). Thus the broad spectrum antiviral peptides against S2 would be an important preventive and treatment modality for testing in animal models before clinical trials [18] . Though the S1 subunit of 2019-nCoV shares around 70% identity to that of the two bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoV (Figure 3(A) ), the core domain of RBD (excluding the external subdomain) are highly conserved (Figure 3(B) ). Most of the amino acid differences of RBD are located in the external subdomain, which is responsible for the direct interaction with the host receptor. Further investigation of this soluble variable external subdomain region will reveal its receptor usage, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis. Unlike 2019-nCoV and human SARS-CoV, most known bat SARSr-CoVs have two stretches of deletions in the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) when compared with that of human SARS-CoV. But some Yunnan strains such as the WIV1 had no such deletions and can use human ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor. It is interesting to note that the two bat SARS-related coronavirus ZXC21 and ZC45, being closest to 2019-nCoV, can infect suckling rats and cause inflammation in the brain tissue, and pathological changes in lung & intestine. However, these two viruses could not be isolated in Vero E6 cells and were not investigated further. The two retained deletion sites in the Spike genes of ZXC21 and ZC45 may lessen their likelihood of jumping species barriers imposed by receptor specificity.\n\nA novel short putative protein with 4 helices and no homology to existing SARS-CoV or SARS-r-CoV protein was found within Orf3b ( Figure 4 ). It is notable that SARS-CoV deletion mutants lacking orf3b replicate to levels similar to those of wildtype virus in several cell types [19] , suggesting that orf3b is dispensable for viral replication in vitro. But orf3b may have a role in viral pathogenicity as Vero E6 but not 293T cells transfected with a construct expressing Orf3b underwent necrosis as early as 6 h after transfection and underwent simultaneous necrosis and apoptosis at later time points [20] . Orf3b was also shown to inhibit expression of IFN-\u03b2 at synthesis and signalling [21] . Subsequently, orf3b homologues identified from three bat SARSrelated-CoV strains were C-terminally truncated and lacked the C-terminal nucleus localization signal of SARS-CoV [22] . IFN antagonist activity analysis demonstrated that one SARS-related-CoV orf3b still possessed IFN antagonist and IRF3-modulating activities. These results indicated that different orf3b proteins display different IFN antagonist activities and this function is independent of the protein's nuclear localization, suggesting a potential link between bat SARS-related-CoV orf3b function and pathogenesis. The importance of this new protein in 2019-nCoV will require further validation and study.\n\nOrf8 orf8 is an accessory protein found in the Betacoronavirus lineage B coronaviruses. Human SARS-CoVs isolated from early-phase patients, all civet SARS-CoVs, and other bat SARS-related CoVs contain fulllength orf8 [23] . However, a 29-nucleotide deletion,\n\nBat SL-CoV ZXC21 2018\n\nBat which causes the split of full length of orf8 into putative orf8a and orf8b, has been found in all SARS-CoV isolated from mid-and late-phase human patients [24] . In addition, we have previously identified two bat SARS-related-CoV (Bat-CoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C) and proposed that the original SARS-CoV full-length orf8 is acquired from these two bat SARS-related-CoV [25] . Since the SARS-CoV is the closest human pathogenic virus to the 2019-nCoV, we performed phylogenetic analysis and multiple alignments to investigate the orf8 amino acid sequences. The orf8 protein sequences used in the analysis derived from early phase SARS-CoV that includes full-length orf8 (human SARS-CoV GZ02), the mid-and late-phase SARS-CoV that includes the split orf8b (human SARS-CoV Tor2), civet SARS-CoV (paguma SARS-CoV), two bat SARS-related-CoV containing full-length orf8 (bat-CoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C), 2019-nCoV, the other two closest bat SARS-related-CoV to 2019-nCoV SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45), and bat SARS-related-CoV HKU3-1 ( Figure 5(A) ). As expected, orf8 derived from 2019-nCoV belongs to the group that includes the closest genome sequences of bat SARS-related-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45. Interestingly, the new 2019-nCoV orf8 is distant from the conserved orf8 or Figure 5(B) ) which was shown to trigger intracellular stress pathways and activates NLRP3 inflammasomes [26] , but this is absent in this novel orf8 of 2019-nCoV. Based on a secondary structure prediction, this novel orf8 has a high possibility to form a protein with an alpha-helix, following with a betasheet(s) containing six strands ( Figure 5(C) ).\n\nThe genome of 2019-nCoV has overall 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-related-CoV SL-CoVZXC21 (MG772934.1), and 82% with human SARS-CoV BJ01 2003 (AY278488) and human SARS-CoV Tor2 (AY274119). The phylogenetic trees constructed using the amino acid sequences of orf1a/b and the 4 structural genes (S, E, M, and N) were shown (Figure 6(A-E) ). For all these 5 genes, the 2019-nCoV was clustered with lineage B \u03b2CoVs. It was most closely related to the bat SARS-related CoVs ZXC21 and ZC45 found in Chinese horseshoe \n\nAs shown in Figure 7 (A-C), the SARS-CoV 5 \u2032 -UTR contains SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, S5, SL5A, SL5B, SL5C, SL6, SL7, and SL8. The SL3 contains trans-cis motif [27] . The SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, S5, SL5A, SL5B, and SL5C structures were similar among the 2019-nCoV, human SARS-CoV and the bat SARS-related ZC45. In the 2019-nCoV, part of the S5 found was inside Figure 7 Continued the orf1a/b (marked in red), which was similar to SARS-CoV. In bat SARS-related CoV ZC45, the S5 was not found inside orf1a/b. The 2019-nCoV had the same SL6, SL7, and SL8 as SARS-CoV, and an additional stem loop. Bat SARS-related CoV ZC45 did not have the SARS-COV SL6-like stem loop. Instead, it possessed two other stem loops in this region. All three strains had similar SL7 and SL8. The bat SARS-like CoV ZC45 also had an additional stem loop between SL7 and SL8. Overall, the 5 \u2032 -UTR of 2019-nCoV was more similar to that of SARS-CoV than the bat SARS-related CoV ZC 45. The biological relevance and effects of virulence of the 5 \u2032 -UTR structures should be investigated further. The 2019-nCoV had various 3 \u2032 -UTR structures, including BSL, S1, S2, S3, S4, L1, L2, L3, and HVR (Figure 7(D-F) ). The 3 \u2032 -UTR was conserved among 2019-nCoV, human SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs [27] .\n\nIn summary, 2019-nCoV is a novel lineage B Betacoronavirus closely related to bat SARS-related coronaviruses. It also has unique genomic features which deserves further investigation to ascertain their roles in viral replication cycle and pathogenesis. More animal sampling to determine its natural animal reservoir and intermediate animal host in the market is important. This will shed light on the evolutionary history of this emerging coronavirus which has jumped into human after the other two zoonotic Betacoroanviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.", "document_id": 2634}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where was COVID19 first discovered?", "id": 4221, "answers": [{"text": "Wuhan, Hubei Province, China", "answer_start": 2778}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-020-0233-6\n\nSHA: fd28e6d03eef27b0454f13ca539dc1498242a4c2\n\nAuthors: Jin, Ying-Hui; Cai, Lin; Cheng, Zhen-Shun; Cheng, Hong; Deng, Tong; Fan, Yi-Pin; Fang, Cheng; Huang, Di; Huang, Lu-Qi; Huang, Qiao; Han, Yong; Hu, Bo; Hu, Fen; Li, Bing-Hui; Li, Yi-Rong; Liang, Ke; Lin, Li-Kai; Luo, Li-Sha; Ma, Jing; Ma, Lin-Lu; Peng, Zhi-Yong; Pan, Yun-Bao; Pan, Zhen-Yu; Ren, Xue-Qun; Sun, Hui-Min; Wang, Ying; Wang, Yun-Yun; Weng, Hong; Wei, Chao-Jie; Wu, Dong-Fang; Xia, Jian; Xiong, Yong; Xu, Hai-Bo; Yao, Xiao-Mei; Yuan, Yu-Feng; Ye, Tai-Sheng; Zhang, Xiao-Chun; Zhang, Ying-Wen; Zhang, Yin-Gao; Zhang, Hua-Min; Zhao, Yan; Zhao, Ming-Juan; Zi, Hao; Zeng, Xian-Tao; Wang, Yong-Yan; Wang, Xing-Huan; Management, for the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University Novel Coronavirus; Research Team, Evidence-Based Medicine Chapter of China International Exchange; Promotive Association for, Medical; Health, Care\nDate: 2020\nDOI: 10.1186/s40779-020-0233-6\nLicense: cc-by\n\nAbstract: In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province; and then named \u201c2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world\u2019s attention but without treatment and control manual. For the request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV. Moreover, we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for 2019-nCoV infections. This rapid advice guideline is suitable for the first frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections, community residents, public health persons, relevant researchers, and all person who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.\n\nText: In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was discovered and identified in the viral pneumonia cases that occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China; And then was named by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. In the following month, the 2019-nCoV quickly spreading inside and outside of Hubei Province and even other countries. What's more, the sharp increase of the case number caused widespread panic among the people.\n\nMedical professionals require an up-to-date guideline to follow when an urgent healthcare problem emerging. In response to the requests for reliable advice from frontline clinicians and public healthcare professionals managing 2019-nCoV pandemics, we developed this rapid advance guideline, involving disease epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment, nursing, and hospital infection control for clinicians, and also for public health workers and community residents.\n\nThis guideline was prepared in accordance with the methodology and general rules of WHO Guideline Development and the WHO Rapid Advice Guidelines [1, 2] .\n\nThis guideline development group is multidisciplinary and composed of individuals from health professionals and methodologists. Health professionals included frontline clinical doctors, nurses who work in departments of respiratory medicine, fever clinic, critical medicine, emergency, infectious disease, and experts of respiratory infectious disease and hospital management board. The methodologists included methodologists of guideline development, systematic review, and literature searching professionals.\n\nThis guideline is suitable for frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections, healthy community residents, personnel in public healthcare, relevant researchers, and all persons who are interested in the 2019-nCoV management.\n\nThis guideline is aimed to serve the healthcare professionals to tackle the suspected 2019-nCoV infected cases, confirmed 2019-nCoV infected cases, clustered 2019-nCoV infected cases, and those with close contacts or suspicious exposure to 2019-nCoV infected cases.\n\nOral inquiry for financial interests of relevant personal was conducted at the first meeting while to start this guideline. Relevant financial as well as nonfinancial interests were surveyed and disclosed and subsequently assessed in consensus conference in order to minimize potential bias in guideline development. Finally, there is no conflict of interests for all the personnel participating to prepare this guideline.\n\nThis guideline is a rapid guideline to responding to the emerging infectious disease of 2019-nCoV. Due to the urgent need and tight work schedule, we conducted no wide-range survey but a discussion meeting with front-line clinicians who managed patients with 2019-nCoV infections to finalize guideline topics and key questions.\n\n2.6 Literature searching and preparation of evidence profiles 2.6.1 General notes\n\nConsidering the lack of direct evidence for this newly identified 2019-nCoV infection, we searched and referred to the guidelines that related to the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and influenza. We also referred to the guidelines which were newly-issued by the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China and WHO for 2019-nCoV. In addition, we have an independent literature searching team to search available indirect evidence from systematic reviews and/or RCTs (randomized controlled trials), which were for the treatment and/ or chemoprophylaxis of SARS, MERS, or other influenza virus infections.\n\nIf the existing evidence addressed topics or questions covered by the guideline, then its quality should be assessed. If there is a lack of higher-level quality evidence, our panel considered observational studies and case series. Because of the limited time, we did not perform new systematic review. We identified relevant literature up to 20 January 2020.\n\nWe searched the bibliographic databases: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library.\n\nWe also searched following websites: the WHO (https://www.who.int/), CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/), NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, https://www.nice.org.uk/), National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov. cn/), and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (http://www.satcm.gov.cn/).\n\nAs the 2019-nCoV is a newly identified pathogen responsible for the outbreak of the pandemic disease, there is no sufficient evidence to reveal the whole nature of this virus. In these situations, obtaining evidence from the experts who fighting the disease on the frontline can be efficient and the main source [3] .\n\nUntil to 24:00 on 29 January 2020, 11,500 persons were screened, and 276 were identified as suspected infectious victims, and 170 were diagnosed (including 33 in critical condition) for 2019-nCoV infection in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. During this process, frontline clinicians and nurses have accumulated valuable experience in the diagnosis, treatment and nursing for 2019-nCoV infected patients. Hence, these experiences were assessed and then used as \"Expert Evidence\" for our guideline development. We took interviews and group surveys to collect information on treatment evidence during the guideline panel's meeting, so that it could be integrated into the guideline panel in the summary of findings (see Additional files 1 and 2). Experts' evidence can be solicited by the description of case reports, summaries, and reports of topics or questions of all cases they management.\n\nWe accorded to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) basic approaches and rules [4, 5] , and particularly considered experts' evidence to assess the quality of a body of evidence to make recommendations.\n\nThe quality of evidence reflects whether the extent to which our confidence estimating the effect is adequate to support a particular recommendation. The level of evidence was categorized as \"high quality\", \"moderate quality\", \"low quality\", or \"very low quality\"; Recommendations were classified as \"strong\" or \"weak.\"\n\nThe strong recommendation does not always mean there is sufficient intervention effectiveness. Besides the effectiveness of intervention, the forming of recommendations is based on the severity of the disease, patient willingness, safety, and economics [4] . See Tables 1 and 2 [4, 6] .\n\nBefore meetings, experts' evidence was collected systematically and available to panel members. Once the evidence has been identified and assessed, recommendations were formulated based on the evidence by a face-to-face meeting of panel members and supplemented by experts participating in the panel meeting.\n\nExperts' evidence was highly valued in this guideline development. During the consensus process, if the evidence was agreed on by more than 70% frontline clinicians in the consensus meeting, it is considered as highquality evidence.\n\nIn specific recomendations, we used \"should\" or \"strongly recommend\" for strong recommendations; whereas, \"suggest\" or \"consider\" was used for weak ones.\n\nThis guideline was published in both Chinese and English versions at the same time. Due to space limitations, the current standard revision does not include evidence descriptions. The full revision will be published in New Medicine (Chinese name: Yixue Xinzhi; http://www. jnewmed.com/), Volume 30 and Issue 1 2020 [7] .\n\nSince December 2019, multiple cases occurring unexplainable pneumonia were successively reported in some hospitals in Wuhan city with a history of exposure to a large Hua'nan seafood market in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. It has been confirmed to be an acute respiratory infection caused by a novel coronavirus. So far, the number of cases without a history of the Hua'nan seafood market exposure is increasing. In addition, clustered cases and confirmed cases without a history of travel to Wuhan emerged. Also, confirmed cases without clear exposure to the Wuhan seafood market have been found in many foreign countries or regions [8] .\n\nAt 24:00 on 26 January 2020, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China has recorded a total of 2744 confirmed cases of pneumonia with 2019-nCoV infection from 30 provinces (districts and cities), including 461 severe cases and 80 deaths. A total of 51 cases have been cured and discharged. At present, 5794 suspected cases were recorded, 32,799 with close contacts to the confirmed patients have been tracked, 583 people were released from medical observation that day, and 30,453 people were still undergoing medical observation. A total of confirmed cases were reported from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan of China: 8 cases in Hong Kong, 5 cases in Macao, and 4 cases in Taiwan. In addition, confirmed cases had been reported from abroad: 7 in Thailand, 4 in Australia, 4 in Singapore, 3 in France, 3 in Japan, 3 in Korea, 3 in \n\nWild animal, bats [10] is the most possible host of the 2019-nCoV. It requires further confirmation whether pneumonia infected by the 2019-nCoV is transmitted directly from bats or through an intermediate host. It is believed that clarifying the source of the virus will help determine zoonotic transmission patterns [11] .\n\nUp to present, the main infection source was the patients who with pneumonia infected by the 2019-nCoV. Respiratory droplet transmission is the main route of transmission, and it can also be transmitted through contact [12] . Although many details, such as the source of the virus and its ability to spread between people remain unknown, an increasing number of cases show the signs of human-tohuman transmission [8, 13] .\n\nThe 2019-nCoV isolated from the lower respiratory tract of patients with unexplainable pneumonia in Wuhan, and it is a novel coronavirus belonging to the \u03b2 genus. The 2019-nCoV has an envelope; its particles are round or oval, often polymorphic, with a diameter from 60 nm to 140 nm. Its genetic characteristics are significantly different from SARSr-CoV (SARS related coronaviruses) and MERSr-CoV (MERS related coronaviruses). Current research shows it has more than 85% homology with SARSr-CoV (bat-SL-CoVZC45). 2019-nCoV can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells 96 h after in vitro isolation and culture, while it takes about 6 days in VeroE6 or Huh-7 cell lines [12] . The source of the virus, the time span of the patients discharging infective virus, and the pathogenesis are still not clear [14] .\n\nNo evidence of viral mutation has been found so far [14] . It is necessary to obtain much more clinically isolated viruses with time and geographical variety to assess the extent of the virus mutations, and also whether these mutations indicate adaptability to human hosts [11] .\n\nBased on currently epidemiological survey, the latency period is generally from 3 to 7 days, with a maximum of 14 days [10] . Unlike SARSr-CoV, 2019-nCoV is contagious during the latency period [15] . The evidence agreed on by more than 70% frontline clinicians in consensus meeting is viewed as high-quality evidence\n\nThe population is generally susceptible to the virus. The elderly and those with underlying diseases show more serious conditions after infection, and children and infants also get infected by the 2019-nCoV. From current knowledge of the cases, most patients have a good prognosis, the symptoms of children are relatively mild, and a few patients are in critical condition. Death cases are more frequently seen in the elderly and those with chronic underlying diseases [12] . The newest study including the first 41 confirmed cases admitted to Wuhan between 16 December 2019 and 2 January 2020 showed the median age of patients was 49 years; and the main underlying diseases were diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Of them, 12 cases experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 13 cases were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 6 cases died [16] . Patients with any 2 of the following clinical features and any epidemiological risk: (1) clinical features: fever, imaging features of pneumonia, normal or reduced white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count in the early stages of the disease onset. (2) epidemiologic risk: a history of travel to or residence in Wuhan city, China or other cities with continuous transmission of local cases in the last 14 days before symptom onset; contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city, China or other cities with continuous transmission of local cases in the last 14 days before symptom onset; or epidemiologically connected to 2019-nCoV infections or clustered onsets [12] .\n\nThose with one of the following pathogenic evidence is the confirmed case: (1) positive for the 2019-nCoV by the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples [17] . 2) viral gene sequencing shows highly homogeneity to the known 2019-nCoV in respiratory or blood samples [12] .\n\nSuspected clustering cases are defined when one confirmed case and at the same time, one or more cases of fever or respiratory infection are found in a small area (such as a family, a construction site, a unit, etc.) within 14 days.\n\nUnder the above circumstances, 2 or more confirmed cases are found, and there is the possibility of human-tohuman transmission due to close contact or infection due to co-exposure, then it is determined as a clustered case [8, 18] .\n\nThose who have one of the following contacts after the onset of confirmed cases in the absence of effective protection [18] : (1) those who live, study, work, or have close contact with the confirmed cases, or other close contacts such as working closely with or sharing the same classroom or living in the same house with the confirmed case. (2) medical and nursing staffs and their family members living with them, who treated, nursed or visited the confirmed case, or other personnel who have similar close contact with the case, such as providing direct treatment or care of the case, visiting the case or staying in a closed environment where the cases are located; other patients or caregivers in the same room with the case. (3) people who have close contact with the patients in a same transport vehicle, including those who had taken care of the patients on the vehicle; the person who had companied the patients (family members, colleagues, friends, etc.); other passengers and traffic staff considered having likely close contact with the patients by investigation and evaluation. (4) other circumstances considered to be closely contacted with the person with close contact with the patients by the professional investigation and evaluation.\n\nPersons with suspicious exposure are those who are exposed without effective protection to processing, sales, handling, distributing, or administrative management of wild animals, materials, and the environments that are positive for the 2019-nCoV test [18] .\n\nPersons with close contacts and suspicious exposure should be advised to have a 14-day health observation period, which starts from the last day of contact with the 2019-nCoV infected patients or suspicious environmental exposure. Once they display any symptoms, especially fever, respiratory symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, or diarrhea, they should reach out for medical attention immediately [19] . Contact surveillance should be carried out for those who had exposed to accidental contact, low-level exposure to suspected or confirmed patients, i.e. checking any potential symptoms when carrying out daily activities [20] . See Table 3 for details [21] .\n\nPatients with a suspected infection should be isolated, monitored, and diagnosed in hospital as soon as possible. Doctors should make recommendations based on the patient's situation. Patients with mild symptoms and suspected infection may consider in-home isolation and home care (weak recommendation). Suspected infected with severe symptoms and those who need to stay in hospital for observation by doctor's judgment should follow the isolation guidelines for suspected patients (see Tables 4 and 5 for details).\n\nIt should also be noted that: (1) whether the suspected patients should be given in-home isolation and care or not requires careful clinical evaluation and safety assessment by professionals. (2) if the suspected patients do not get improvement in the symptoms or even worsened in condition during home care, they need to go to the doctor for treatment. (3) during the period of home care, the patients' medication and symptoms should be closely recorded and their caregivers should also monitor their body temperature daily.\n\nThroughout the period of home care, healthcare personnel should perform regular (e.g., daily) follow-up through face-to-face visits or phone interviews (ideally, if feasible) to follow the progress of symptoms and, if necessary, specific diagnostic tests should be conducted [14, 19, 21] .\n\nInternational visitors should take routine precautions when entering and leaving the affected areas, including avoiding close contacts with people with acute respiratory infection, washing hands frequently, especially after contacting with the sick or their surrounding environment; following appropriate coughing etiquette; and avoiding close contact with live or dead farming animals or bats or other wild animals [22, 23] . Passengers should avoid unnecessary travel as possible.\n\nIf they had travelled to Hubei Province (especially Wuhan city) in the past 14 days and is in fever, cough or difficulty in breathing, they should: (1) see a doctor immediately; (2) call the doctor about his/her recent trips and symptoms before going to the doctor's office or emergency room; (3) avoid contact with others; (4) not to travel around; (5) cover mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve (not hands) when coughing or sneezing; and (6) wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 s. If soap and water are not available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizers [24] .\n\nThe 2019-nCoV infected cases have symptoms like fever, fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea etc., with or without nasal congestion, runny nose or other upper respiratory symptoms [13, 16] . Despite the atypical symptoms were reported [25] , Nan-Shan Zhong, the academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering in an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency on 28 January 2020, pointed out that fever is still the typical symptom of 2019-nCoV infection.\n\nPatients with mild symptoms may not present positive signs. Patients in severe condition may have shortness of breath, moist rales in lungs, weakened breath sounds, dullness in percussion, and increased or decreased tactile speech tremor, etc.\n\nThe imaging findings vary with the patient's age, immunity status, disease stage at the time of scanning, underlying diseases, and drug interventions. When walking on the road or waiting in the hospital, try to stay away from other people (at least 1 m away) and wear a mask.\n\nThe family members accompanying those for inspection should immediately follow the monitoring recommendations to close contacts, keep the respiratory hygiene and clean their hands properly.\n\nThe community or street hospital should be informed before the suspected contacts to the hospital. The vehicle used should be cleaned and disinfected with 500 mg/L chlorine-containing disinfectant, and the window should be opened for ventilation. The imaging features of lesions show: (1) dominant distribution (mainly subpleural, along the bronchial vascular bundles); (2) quantity (often more than three or more lesions, occasional single or double lesions); (3) shape (patchy, large block, nodular, lumpy, honeycomblike or grid-like, cord-like, etc.); (4) density (mostly uneven, a paving stones-like change mixed with ground glass density and interlobular septal thickening, consolidation and thickened bronchial wall, etc.); and (5) concomitant signs vary (air-bronchogram, rare pleural effusion and mediastinal lymph nodes enlargement, etc.).\n\nTypical CT/X-ray imaging manifestation, including\n\n(1) Multiple, patchy, sub-segmental or segmental groundglass density shadows in both lungs. They were classified as \"paving stone-like\" changes by fine-grid or small honeycomb-like thickening of interlobular septa. The thinner the CT scan layers, the clearer the ground-glass opacity and thickening of interlobular septa were displayed. A slightly high-density and ground-glass change with fuzzy edge in the fine-grid or small honeycomb-like thickening of interlobular septa were presented by the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), ( Fig. 1: 45 cases, 54.2% in a total of 83 cases). The resolution of X-ray was worse lower than that of CT in the resolution, which was basically manifested as ground-glass When coughing or sneezing, it is necessary to wear a medical mask, or cover with a paper towel and bent elbow, and clean hands immediately after coughing and sneezing.\n\nStrong 10 N95 masks should be worn in the same room with patients (preferred strategy).\n\nDisposable surgical mask (alternative strategy). Use the mask in strict accordance with the instruction manual.\n\nAfter washing hands with running water, dry them with a paper towel (preferred strategy).\n\nDry with a towel, and wash and disinfect the towel daily (alternative strategy).\n\nHome caregivers 1 Clean and disinfect hands after contact with the patient, before leaving patient's room or the house, before and after eating, after using the toilet and after entering house from outside (for visible contaminant on hands, wash hands with running water then use hand disinfection).\n\nAvoid direct contact with patient's secretions or discharges, especially oral or respiratory discharges; avoid direct contact with patient's feces. (2) Multiple, patchy or large patches of consolidation in both lungs, with a little grid-like or honeycombshaped interlobular septal thickening, especially in the middle and lower lobes ( Fig. 3: 26 cases, 31.3% in a total of 83 cases). It was more common in the elderly or severe condition patients.\n\nAtypical CT/X-ray imaging manifestation, including (1) Single, or multiple, or extensive subpleural grid-like or honeycomb-like thickening of interlobular septum, thickening of the bronchial wall, and tortuous and thick strand-like opacity. Several patchy consolidations, occasionally with a small amount pleural effusion or enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, can be seen ( Fig. 4 : 6 cases, 7.2% in a total of 83 cases). This is mostly seen in the elderly.\n\n(2) Single or multiple solid nodules or consolidated nodules in the center of lobule, surrounded by ground-glass opacities ( Fig. 5 : 5 cases, 6.2% in a total of 83 cases).\n\nStage based on CT image The CT imaging demonstrates 5 stages according to the time of onset and the response of body to the virus, including:\n\n(1) Ultra-early stage. This stage usually refers to the stage of patients without clinical manifestation, negative laboratory test but positive throat swab for 2019-nCoV (2) Early stage.This stage refers to the period of 1-3 days after clinical manifestations (fever, cough, dry cough, etc.). The pathological process during this stage is dilatation and congestion of alveolar septal capillary, exudation of fluid in alveolar cavity and interlobular interstitial edema. It showed that single or multiple scattered patchy or agglomerated ground-glass opacities, separated by honeycomb-like or grid-like thickened of interlobular septa ( Fig. 7 : 45 cases, 54.2% in a total of 83 cases). \n\nIt mainly should be distinguished from other known viral virus of pneumonia, such as influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, SARSr-CoV, etc.; and also from mycoplasma pneumonia, chlamydia pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia. In addition, it should be distinguished from non-infectious diseases, such as vasculitis, dermatomyositis, and organizing pneumonia.\n\nIn the early stage of the disease, the total number of leukocytes decreased or keeps normal, with decreased lymphocyte count or increased or normal monocytes. High attention should be paid on the situation where the absolute value of lymphocyte is less than 0.8 \u00d7 10 9 /L, or the numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells are significantly decreased, which generally recommend rechecking the blood routine changes after 3 days.\n\n(1) Flu antigens. At present, routinely detected flu antigens are A, B, and H7N-subtypes. Sampling of throat swabs is conducive to early rapid screening for flu because of the fast test, but it has a relatively high false negative rate. (2) Respiratory virus nucleic acid. The detection of respiratory virus nucleic acid is commonly used to \n\nIn the early stage of this disease, the total number of leukocytes in peripheral blood was normal or decreased, and the lymphocyte count decreased. In some patients, liver enzyme (transaminase), creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin increased. CRP, ESR, and IL-6 increased, and PCT was normal in most patients. The increased Ddimer occurred in severe cases. Compared with 120 healthy check-ups, the absolute value of lymphocyte (0.87 vs 2.13) \u00d7 10 9 /L, lymphocyte percentage (19.5% vs 33.7%), eosinophil percentage (0.13% vs 2.16%), and absolute value (0.0061 vs 0.1417) \u00d7 10 9 /L in 2019-nCoV patients were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The absolute number (4.2 vs 3.7) \u00d7 10 9 /L and the percentage (72.0% vs 57.0%) increased in 2019-nCoV patients (P < 0.05). The percentage of monocytes increased slightly (8.1% vs 6.8%), while the absolute number of monocytes did not change significantly (0.38 vs 0.44) \u00d7 10 9 /L.\n\nThe next generation sequencing (NGS) and electron microscope technology play a role in the early diagnosis, but their diagnostic values have been weakened by the discovery of specific nucleic acid detection technology. In addition, NGS detection can tell whether the pathogen has mutated or not.\n\nSuspected and confirmed cases need to be treated in designated hospitals with effective isolation and protection conditions. Suspected cases need to be treated separately in single room, confirmed cases are admitted to a same ward, and critical cases should be admitted to ICU as soon as possible.\n\n(1) The patient should rest in bed, being monitored for vital signs (heart rate, pulse oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood pressure) and given supportive treatment to ensure sufficient energy intake and balance for water, electrolytes, acidbase levels and other internal environment factors (Strong recommendation).\n\n(2) The patient should be monitored for blood routine, CRP, PCT, organ function (liver enzyme, bilirubin, myocardial enzyme, creatinine, urea nitrogen, Urine volume, etc.), coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis and chest imaging (Strong recommendation). First, oxygen therapy is the choice for patients with severe respiratory infections, respiratory distress, hypoxemia or shock. The initial flow rate is 5 L/min, and the titration flow rate is to reach the target oxygen saturation (adults: SpO 2 \u2265 90% in non-pregnant patients, SpO 2 \u2265 92-95% in pregnant patients; children: SpO 2 \u2265 94% in children with obstructive dyspnea, apnea, severe respiratory distress, central cyanosis, shock, coma or convulsions, and \u2265 90% in other children).\n\nSecond, respiratory support should be given to patients with hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome. HFNO or NIV can be selected when nasal cannula or mask oxygen therapy was ineffective or the patient had hypoxic respiratory failure. However, when patients had hypercapnia (acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema), hemodynamic instability, multiple organ failure, and abnormal mental status HFNO oxygen is not the routinely adopted measure. If respiratory failure cannot be improved or worsens continuously within a short time (1 h) after using HFNO or NIV, intubation should be performed immediately. Low tidal volume (4-8 ml/kg) and low suction pressure (platform pressure < 30cmH 2 O) are used for invasive mechanical ventilation. It is suggested that positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) with high positive endexpiratory pressure should be used in patients with moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, and PEEP should be titrated according to FiO 2 to maintain SpO 2 , in order to improve alveolar atelectasis and reduce alveolar hyper-expansion and pulmonary vascular resistance at the end of inspiration. For severe patients with ARDS, it is recommended to ventilate in prone position for more than 12 h/d.\n\nshould be considered for the patients with refractory hypoxemia that is difficult to be corrected by protective lung ventilation. (Strong recommendation).\n\n(1) At present, there is no evidence from RCT to support specific drug treatment against the new coronavirus in suspected or confirmed cases. (2) The \u03b1-interferon atomization inhalation can be considered (5 million U per time for adults in sterile injection water, twice a day) (Weak recommendation); lopinavir/ritonavir orally, 2 capsules each time, twice a day, can be also considered (Weak recommendation).\n\nLow-level evidences included retrospective cohort, historically controlled studies, case reports, and case series revealed that lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in combination with antivirals produced certain benefits in the treatment of SARS and MERS, such as reducing the incidence or mortality of ARDS [26] [27] [28] [29] . A recently systematic review showed that lopinavir/ritonavir's anti-coronavirus effect was mainly seen in its early application, for reducing patient mortality and reduced glucocorticoid consumption. However, if the early treatment window is missed, there will be no significant effect in their late application [30] . Real-world study stills need to further explore the clinical effects of its early use in 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia.\n\nThe effectiveness of the combined use of antivirals is still controversial [31] [32] [33] [34] .\n\n(1) Principles. Avoid blind or inappropriate use of antibacterial drugs, especially the combination of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs. Enhancement of bacteriological surveillance should be performed and promptly given appropriate antibacterial drugs when it occurs secondary bacterial infection. (2) According to the clinical manifestations of patients, if the accompanying bacterial infection cannot be ruled out, mild patients can take antibacterial drugs against community-acquired pneumonia, such as amoxicillin, azithromycin, or fluoroquinolones; empirical antibacterial treatment in severe patients should cover all possible pathogens, deescalating therapy until the pathogenic bacteria are clarified.\n\nThe use of corticosteroids for severe ARDS is controversial; therefore, systemic use of glucocorticoids needs to be cautious. Methylprednisolone can be used as appropriate for patients with rapid disease progression or severe illness. According to the severity of the disease, 40 to 80 mg of methylprednisolone per day can be considered, and the total daily dose should not exceed 2 mg/kg (Weak recommendation). SARS management related researches showed that timely use of non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure and corticosteroids is an effective strategy for increased lung shadows and increased dyspnea. Appropriate use of glucocorticoids is able to significantly improve the clinical symptoms of patients with SARS, reduce the degree of disease progression, and accelerate the absorption of lung lesions; but it cannot shorten the length of hospital stay [35, 36] . Be cautious that hormone therapy has some incidence of adverse reactions [37] .\n\n(1) Symptomatic treatment of fever. When the temperature is higher than 38.5 \u2103, ibuprofen can be used for Treat the patient based on syndrome differentiation individually. Prevention before illness is better than treatment after getting diseased.\n\n(1) Community.

The recommended Chinese patent medicine: Shengmaiyin.\n\n6.5 Treatment of severe patients 6.5.1 Hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS treatments Treatment principle: treat the patients to improve the symptoms and underlying diseases, actively prevent potential complications and secondary infection; provide timely measures to support organ function.\n\n(1) Hypoxic respiratory failure and severe ARDS. Give oxygen therapy immediately to patients with ARDS, and closely monitor them for signs of clinical deterioration, such as rapidly progressive respiratory failure. Consider severe hypoxemic respiratory failure when standard oxygen therapy fails. Conservative fluid management can be adopted for ARDS patients without tissue hypoperfusion. Use vasoactive drugs to improve microcirculation. Empirical antibiotics targeting the suspected potential infection should be used as soon as possible, blind or improper combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics should be avoided. Unless for special reasons, the routine use of corticosteroids should be avoided. Glucocorticoids can be used in a short time (3-5 days) according to the degree of dyspnea and the progress of chest imaging if appropriate and the recommended dose is not more than the equivalent to 1-2 mg/kg methylprednisone per day. Provide intensive standard supportive care to the critically ill patients, including prevention of deep vein thrombosis and stress-induced gastrointestinal bleeding, blood glucose control and so on. Enteral nutrition can be provided. Supplemental nutrition with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants is not recommended. Inhaled or intravenous beta-adrenergic agonists are not recommended to promote alveolar fluid clearance and resolution of pulmonary edema.\n\n(1) Recognize the septic shock. When infection is suspected or confirmed, and on the basis of full fluid resuscitation, vasoconstrictor drugs are still needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) \u226565 mmHg with lactate \u22652 mmol/L, the existence of septic shock should be considered. If lactate cannot be monitored for some reasons, the following three manifestations (changes in mental state, oliguria, poor peripheral perfusion and prolonged capillary filling time) should be considered as signs of a combination of infection and hypoperfusion. (2) In resuscitation from septic shock in adults, at least 30 ml/kg of isotonic crystalloid was considered for adults in the first 3 h. In resuscitation from septic shock in children, give 20 ml/kg as a rapid bolus and up to 40-60 ml/kg in first aid. (3) Isosmotic crystal solution is recommended for resuscitation. Do not use hypotonic crystalloids, starches, or gelatins for resuscitation in the first hour. Albumin may be considered as a resuscitation fluid, but this recommendation was based on low-quality evidence under certain conditions. (4) Administer vasoconstrictor is suggested when shock persists after fluid resuscitation, noradrenaline as the first choice. The initial blood pressure target is MAP \u226565 mmHg in adults and age-appropriate targets in children. can also be administered via intraosseous needles.\n\n6.6 Condition evaluation and treatment effect evaluation 6.6.1 Criteria to withdraw ECLS\n\n(1) Remove VV-ECMO. The oxygen concentration of the ECMO air-oxygen mixer has dropped to 21%, the air flow rate has dropped to 0, and the ventilator is not strong enough. Lasting for 2-3 h, the respiratory rate is within 25 breaths/min, SpO 2 > 92%, PaCO 2 is normal, and withdrawal from VV-ECMO may be considered. (2) Remove VA-ECMO. The blood flow rate is reduced to the rate of (0.2 to 0.5 L / min) every 5 to 6 h from 3 L/min, and the hemodynamic condition is stable. The blood flow rate is reduced to 1.5 L/min within 24 h. If there is a bridging tube, the arteriovenous end can be connected with a bridging tube to form an ECMO circuit for self-circulation, so that the body's hemodynamics is driven by the heart. If hemodynamics is stable for at least 6 h, consider removing the machine.\n\nWhen the patient is well aware, cough reflexes are obvious when sucking the sputum, the hemodynamics is stable, and the ventilator parameters are close to offline parameters, the spontaneous breathing test (SBT) is performed. After the SBT is passed, invasive breathing can be considered to remove the endotracheal tube.\n\nPatients do not need advanced respiratory support (HFNO, NIV, MV, ECLS, etc.); stable hemodynamics and tissue perfusion; no significant impairment of organ function; and no need for organ support treatment (CRRT, artificial liver, etc.). Consider transferring the patient out of ICU procedure.\n\nThe body temperature returned to normal for more than 3 days; respiratory symptoms improved significantly; inflammation of the lungs showed obvious signs of absorption; and respiratory nucleic acid was negative for two consecutive times (one-day sampling time interval at least); and the patient can be released from isolation.\n\n7 Prevent and control nosocomial infection 7.1 Restriction and isolation guidelines for patient/ suspected patients See Table 7 . (Strong recommendation).\n\nAccording to the principles of standard prevention and tertiary protection, all personnel entering various zones should be evaluated using individual inventory tables according to the exposure risk level. Chose personal protective equipment of various levels is necessary. Personal protective equipment should be worn strictly in accordance with the instructions and only used for one time ( The patient's home isolation scheme is shown in Table 5 .\n\nPatients should monitor their body temperature and illness at home. If your body temperature continues to be higher than 38 \u2103, or your breath is getting worse, you should seek medical treatment timely.\n\nIn addition to taking protective measures, the home caregivers also should monitor their body temperature closely.\n\nMild patients generally use a nasal catheter and a mask for oxygen. Adjust the oxygen flow as appropriate according to the patient's condition and doctor's instruction, and Requirements to the medical staff request 6. Medical personnel enter the isolation area with proper self-protection through designated channels.\n\n6.1 Medical staff should perform the personal protection practice under the Personal Protection Guidelines in Table 8 closely monitor the patient's breathing and blood oxygen saturation. If oxygen therapy fails to reach the expected effect, the nurse should analyze the cause comprehensively and be vigilant to notify the doctor.\n\nMild patients generally use antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs (when bacterial infection exists), and symptomatic treatment. The doctor's advice should be followed accurately and timely. The adverse reactions of oseltamivir mainly include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and bronchitis, cough, etc. The adverse reactions of interferon are mainly flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache, followed by mild suppression of bone marrow. Attention should be paid to identify the change of clinical manifestations or adverse drug reactions.\n\nAccording to the patients' condition, provide highprotein, high-vitamin, carbohydrate-containing diets (e.g. eggs, fish, lean meat, milk, etc.) for enough nutrition to improve physical condition.\n\nTake good care of the patient and respond to the patient's question timely. Positively encourage patients to reduce their anxiety and fear.\n\nDynamically monitor patients' vital signs, waterelectrolytes balance, acid-base balance, and functions of various organs, monitor patients' infection indicators, and determine the occurrence of complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, stress ulcers, and deep vein thrombosis.\n\nThe critically illed patients mainly use oxygen therapy such as HFNO, NIV and invasive mechanical ventilation. When using various oxygen treatments in a sequential manner, the airway and breathing circuit need to be kept open, and the effect of oxygen treatment needs to be monitored dynamically. At the same time, skincare products need to be used reasonably to avoid damage to the nose, face and lips by pressure. When using a high-flow nasal catheter to inhale oxygen, the oxygen flow and temperature and humidity should be adjusted appropriately. When using non-invasive mechanical ventilation, patient should receive relevant health education. Patients are instructed to inhale through the nose. The pressure is set from low to high and gradually reaches the target value. The human-machine coordination is maximized. The patient's consciousness and respiratory function are closely observed. Patients with artificial airway established should use a closed suction tube to reduce virus spread. Nurses should wear goggles or a face shield to avoid occupational exposure.\n\nIf the patient develops moderate to severe ARDS, invasive mechanical ventilation combined with a prone position need to be adopted. Standard operating procedure for prone position needs to be followed. At the same time, be cautious to prevent pressure ulcers, falling bed, tube slippage, and eye damage by pressure and other complications. Patients treated with ECMO should be monitored for the performance of the oxygenator. If the oxygenator changes its color to darker, indicating the possibility of coagulation, the doctor should be notified to adjust the heparin dose as necessary. The oxygenator should be replaced if necessary. The coagulation function need to be monitored dynamically, including the whole set of coagulation and DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), and the time of activating partial thromboplastin, etc., the patient should be closely observed for signs of bleeding, such as bruising on the skin and mucous membranes, bleeding in the nasal cavity, oral cavity, bloody sputum, hematuria, blood in the stool, swelling of the abdomen, moving dullness, and the size of bilateral pupils. Make sure that the ECMO pipelines are tightly connected and firmly fixed to prevent air embolism and pipeline slippage.\n\nPerform oral care and skin care, assist the patient to use toilet, and take eyes on the indwelling tubes. Rules and regulations for aseptic operation and isolation should be strictly followed to prevent ventilator-related pneumonia, catheter-related sepsis, urinary catheter related urinary tract infections and other secondary infections.\n\nDynamically assess the patients' nutritional risks and timely nutritional support can be given if needed. For the patients who can eat, the diet rich in protein and carbohydrates is recommended. Those patients who cannot eat but are compatible with enteral nutrition should be given enteral nutrition as soon as possible. For the patients incompatible with enteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition should be given timely to meet energy requirement.\n\nPsychological and humanistic care should be performed in high priority especially for the awake patients. Psychological techniques like mindfulness -based stress reduction can be adopted to relieve the patients' anxiety and panic by building up their optimistic confidence in overcoming the disease.\n\nOur guideline has three major limitations: Firstly, time is so limited that we cannot fully consider all clinical issues for this emergency disease. Secondly, many evidences came from data search is indirect. Thirdly, because some recommendations are based on the evidence from existing guidelines and experts' experience, there are situations where strong recommendations were produced on the base of low-quality evidence or very low-quality evidence, so high-quality evidence, when they appear, is likely to change current recommendations.\n\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10. 1186/s40779-020-0233-6.\n\nAdditional file 1.

Meanwhile, on 7 January 2020, the novel coronavirus, currently named 2019-nCoV, was officially announced as the causative agent by Chinese authorities [3] . In order to support public health action, viral genome sequences were released by Chinese researchers on 10 January [4] and 2 days later, four further sequences were also made available on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/). While more cases are being reported on a daily basis and there is evidence for some human-to-human transmission in China, a number of important questions remain unanswered. For example, there is no certainty about the source of the outbreak, the transmissibility of the virus as well as the clinical picture and severity of the disease.\n\nIn this issue of Eurosurveillance, we are publishing two articles on different aspects of the newly emerged 2019-nCoV. One is a research article by Corman et al. on the development of a diagnostic methodology based on RT-PCR of the E and RdRp genes, without the need for virus material; the assays were validated in five international laboratories [5] . Before this publication, a description of the assays had already been made publically available on a dedicated WHO webpage [6] to support rapid development of laboratory testing capacities. The other is a rapid communication where researchers based in Hong Kong report on their attempt to estimate the severity among hospitalised cases of 2019-nCoV infection through modelling based on publically available information, mainly from Wuhan health authorities [7] . It also points out the need for more detailed information to make an informed evaluation of the situation as basis for public health decision-making.\n\nToday, the WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, taking into consideration the deliberations of the members of the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee on 2019-nCoV in their second meeting, decided not to declare a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nInternational health organisations such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO are monitoring the situation and provide regular updates.

As of 18 March 2020, a total number of 194909 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 7876 deaths, the majority of which have been reported in China (3242) and Italy (2505)(3). However, as the pandemic is still unfortunately under progression, there are limited data with regard to the clinical characteristics of the patients as well as to their prognostic factors(4). Smoking, to date, has been assumed to be possibly associated with adverse disease prognosis, as extensive evidence has highlighted the negative impact of tobacco use on lung health and its causal association with a plethora of respiratory diseases(5). Smoking is also detrimental to the immune system and its responsiveness to infections, making smokers more vulnerable to infectious diseases(6). Previous studies have shown that smokers are twice more likely than non-smokers to contract influenza and have more severe symptoms, while smokers were also noted to have higher mortality in the previous MERS-CoV outbreak(7,8). Given the gap in the evidence, we conducted a systematic review of studies on COVID-19 that included information on patients\u2019 smoking status to evaluate the association between smoking and COVID-19 outcomes including the severity of the disease, the need for mechanical ventilation, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization and death. The literature search was conducted on 17 March 2020, using two databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect), with the search terms: [\u2018smoking\u2019 OR \u2018tobacco\u2019 OR \u2018risk factors\u2019 OR \u2018smoker*\u2019] AND [\u2018COVID-19\u2019 OR \u2018COVID 19\u2019 OR \u2018novel coronavirus\u2019 OR \u2018sars cov-2\u2019 OR \u2018sars cov 2\u2019] and included studies published in 2019 and 2020. Further inclusion criteria were that the studies were in English and referred to humans. We also searched the reference lists of the studies included. A total of 71 studies were retrieved through the search, of which 66 were excluded after full-text screening, leaving five studies that were included. All of the studies were conducted in China, four in Wuhan and one across provinces in mainland China. The populations in all studies were patients with COVID-19, and the sample size ranged from 41 to 1099 patients. With regard to the study design, retrospective and prospective methods were used, and the timeframe of all five studies covered the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2019, January 2020). Specifically, Zhou et al.(9) studied the epidemiological characteristics of 191 individuals infected with COVID-19, without, however, reporting in more detail the mortality risk factors and the clinical outcomes of the disease. Among the 191 patients, there were 54 deaths, while 137 survived. Among those that died, 9% were current smokers compared to 4% among those that survived, with no statistically significant difference between the smoking rates of survivors and non-survivors (p=0.21) with regard to mortality from COVID-19. Similarly, Zhang et al.(10) presented clinical characteristics of 140 patients with COVID-19. The results showed that among severe patients (n=58), 3.4% were current smokers and 6.9% were former smokers, in contrast to non-severe patients (n=82) among which 0% were current smokers and 3.7% were former smokers , leading to an OR of 2.23; (95% CI: 0.65\u20137.63; p=0.2). Huang et al.(11) studied the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 among 41 patients. In this study, none of those who needed to be admitted to an ICU (n=13) was a current smoker. In contrast, three patients from the non-ICU group were current smokers, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients (p=0.31), albeit the small sample size of the study. The largest study population of 1099 patients with COVID-19 was provided by Guan et al.(12) from multiple regions of mainland China. Descriptive results on the smoking status of patients were provided for the 1099 patients, of which 173 had severe symptoms, and 926 had non-severe symptoms. Among the patients with severe symptoms, 16.9% were current smokers and 5.2% were former smokers, in contrast to patients with non-severe symptoms where 11.8% were current smokers and 1.3% were former smokers. Additionally, in the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU or died, 25.5% were current smokers and 7.6% were former smokers. In contrast, in the group of patients that did not have these adverse outcomes, only 11.8% were current smokers and 1.6% were former smokers. No statistical analysis for evaluating the association between the severity of the disease outcome and smoking status was conducted in that study. Finally, Liu et al.(13) found among their population of 78 patients with COVID-19 that the adverse outcome group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking (27.3%) than the group that showed improvement or stabilization (3.0%), with this difference statistically significant at the p=0.018 level. In their multivariate logistic regression analysis, the history of smoking was a risk factor of disease progression (OR=14.28; 95% CI: 1.58\u201325.00; p= 0.018). We identified five studies that reported data on the smoking status of patients infected with COVID-19. Notably, in the largest study that assessed severity, there were higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed ICU support, mechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases(12). However, from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1.4 times more likely (RR=1.4, 95% CI: 0.98\u20132.00) to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers (RR=2.4, 95% CI: 1.43\u20134.04). In conclusion, although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data, and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.\n\nText: non-survivors (p=0.21) with regard to mortality from COVID-19. Similarly, Zhang et al. 10 presented clinical characteristics of 140 patients with COVID-19. The results showed that among severe patients (n=58), 3.4% were current smokers and 6.9% were former smokers, in contrast to non-severe patients (n=82) among which 0% were current smokers and 3.7% were former smokers , leading to an OR of 2.23; (95% CI: 0.65-7.63; p=0.2). Huang et al. 11 studied the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 among 41 patients. In this study, none of those who needed to be admitted to an ICU (n=13) was a current smoker. In contrast, three patients from the non-ICU group were current smokers, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients (p=0.31), albeit the small sample size of the study. The largest study population of 1099 patients with COVID-19 was provided by Guan et al. 12 from multiple regions of mainland China. Descriptive results on the smoking status of patients were provided for the 1099 patients, of which 173 had severe symptoms, and 926 had non-severe symptoms. Among the patients with severe symptoms, 16.9% were current smokers and 5.2% were former smokers, in contrast to patients with non-severe symptoms where 11.8% were current smokers and 1.3% were former smokers. Additionally, in the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU or died, 25.5% were current smokers and 7.6% were former smokers. In contrast, in the group of patients that did not have these adverse outcomes, only 11.8% were current smokers and 1.6% were former smokers. No statistical analysis for evaluating the association between the severity of the disease outcome and smoking status was conducted in that study. Finally, Liu et al. 13 found among their population of 78 patients with COVID-19 that the adverse outcome group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking (27.3%) than the group that showed improvement or stabilization (3.0%), with this difference statistically significant at the p=0.018 level. In their multivariate logistic regression analysis, the history of smoking was a risk factor of disease progression (OR=14.28; 95% CI: 1.58-25.00; p= 0.018).\n\nWe identified five studies that reported data on the smoking status of patients infected with COVID-19. Notably, in the largest study that assessed severity, there were higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed ICU support, mechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases 12 . However, from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1.4 times more likely (RR=1.4, 95% CI: 0.98-2.00) to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers (RR=2.4, 95% CI: 1.43-4.04).\n\nIn conclusion, although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data, and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.", "document_id": 1559}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why might we underestimate the spread of COVID19?", "id": 2185, "answers": [{"text": "limited information available regarding incubation time, transmissibility, and virus origin", "answer_start": 3118}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where was the first imported case of COVID19 in the United States?\n", "id": 2186, "answers": [{"text": "Washington", "answer_start": 4564}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the first case of COVID19 confirmed in the USA?", "id": 2187, "answers": [{"text": "January 15, 2020", "answer_start": 4421}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the second COVID19 case reported in the US?", "id": 2188, "answers": [{"text": "January 24, 2020", "answer_start": 4723}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where was the second reported case of COVID in the United States?", "id": 2189, "answers": [{"text": "Chicago", "answer_start": 4667}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the first local transmission of COVID reported in the United States?", "id": 2190, "answers": [{"text": "January 30, 2020", "answer_start": 4929}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did the WHO declare COVID to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern?", "id": 2191, "answers": [{"text": "January 30, 2020", "answer_start": 4929}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did the United States declare COVID19 a public health emergency?", "id": 2192, "answers": [{"text": "January 31, 2020,", "answer_start": 5172}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are the most common symptoms of COVID19?", "id": 2193, "answers": [{"text": "Fever and cough ", "answer_start": 6790}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What symptoms might people experience with COVID19?", "id": 2194, "answers": [{"text": "patients with underlying medical conditions and the elderly", "answer_start": 7166}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who is at greater risk of dying from COVID19?", "id": 2195, "answers": [{"text": "patients with underlying medical conditions and the elderly", "answer_start": 7166}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How long is the incubation time for COVID19?", "id": 2196, "answers": [{"text": "between 2 and 14 days", "answer_start": 7356}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How does COVID19 get spread?", "id": 2197, "answers": [{"text": "close contact with an infected person", "answer_start": 11444}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Is it possible to get infected with COVID and another virus?", "id": 2198, "answers": [{"text": "Although the likelihood of coinfection of 2019-nCoV and another respiratory virus is thought to be low, a positive finding of another respiratory pathogen does not exclude the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV", "answer_start": 14067}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "2019-nCoV: The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081861/\n\nSHA: f323af9a07cc54faf9bdbabadaacb0e8b46f99a2\n\nAuthors: Koenig, Kristi L.; Be\u00ff, Christian K.; McDonald, Eric C.\nDate: 2020-01-31\nDOI: 10.5811/westjem.2020.1.46760\nLicense: cc-by\n\nAbstract: 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging infectious disease closely related to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that was first reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I Tool for use in the initial detection and management of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV. After initial assessment for symptoms and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a risk-stratified system. Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the appropriate public health agencies notified. This modified 3I Tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV.\n\nText: 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a novel respiratory disease first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. 1 Chinese health officials were originally investigating a sudden increase in cases of pneumonia which were later determined to be linked to 2019-nCoV. While most cases originated within mainland China, the disease spread to neighboring countries including Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, and Japan, and later to the United States, Europe, and Australia. A near real-time updated tracking website for cases and locations worldwide, along with reported deaths is available. 2 Chinese health authorities have sequenced 2019-nCoV and freely shared its genetic profile online. 3, 4 Additionally, on January 28, 2020, an Australian laboratory reported growing the virus from a patient sample. As of January 30, 2020, there have been at least 9,776 persons infected and 213 verified deaths. 2 These numbers are likely underestimates due to the limited information available regarding incubation time, transmissibility, and virus origin. The What was the research question? Investigators adapted the \"Identify, Isolate, Inform\" (3I) Tool for use in suspected cases of 2019-nCoV.\n\nWhat was the major finding of the study? A novel 2019-nCoV 3I Tool is designed for frontline clinicians in the management of suspected patients.\n\nThis 2019-nCoV 3I adaptation will aid healthcare providers most likely to encounter the disease in the containment and effective treatment of patients.\n\nage distribution of these verified deaths is currently not available.\n\nOne preliminary, small-scale study of 41 patients in Wuhan China, reported 6 deaths (15% mortality) with a median age of 49.0 years. 5 Additionally, transmission of the virus has reportedly occurred in healthcare facilities in Wuhan City, raising concerns of spread to healthcare workers, as was seen during prior outbreaks of the novel coronaviruses, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Due to the dynamic nature of the outbreak, exposure criteria may change depending on where new cases of 2019-nCoV are detected, the degree of transmissibility, and when additional information regarding the origin of the virus is discovered and reported. On January 15, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first known imported case of 2019-nCoV in the US state of Washington. The patient had recently returned from Wuhan City, where he likely contracted the disease. Chicago health authorities reported a second US case on January 24, 2020. This was quickly followed by additional imported cases reported in Orange and Los Angeles Counties, California on January 26, 2020. Additional suspected cases continue to be evaluated. On January 30, 2020, the CDC reported the first local transmission in the US between members in a household. On the same day, the World Health Organization declared 2019-nCoV to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). 6 On January 31, 2020, the US Department of Health and Human Services declared coronavirus a public health emergency. 7 Healthy individuals and those with mild illness may be asymptomatic, while others may have more pronounced symptoms of fever or lower respiratory illness. Upon identification of a suspected patient, that individual should immediately be isolated with airborne precautions. Further workup and laboratory confirmation can then proceed. Emergency physicians (EPs), emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, and other healthcare workers who encounter patients with suspected 2019-nCoV infection must inform the appropriate authorities, including but not limited to hospital infection control and local or state public health agencies.\n\nHealthcare workers must follow on-going developments related to the outbreak, especially new information concerning detection and management. 8, 9 The 3I Tool outlined in this paper is consistent with current US CDC guidelines and can be applied in a variety of settings such as those in emergency departments, urgent-care clinics, physicians' offices, and prehospital settings. This paper will first briefly review 2019-nCoV and then present the novel 2019-nCoV 3I Tool as modified from its initial conception for Ebola virus disease 10,11 and later adapted for measles, 12 MERS, 13 mumps, 14 Zika virus disease, 15 hepatitis A, 16 pertussis, 17 and scabies. 18 \n\nCoronavirus 2019-nCoV infection commonly presents with signs and symptoms of pneumonia or as a nonspecific lower respiratory illness, with coughing or difficulty breathing accompanied by fever. 5, 19, 20 Fever and cough constitute the most common presentations. However, patients may have other respiratory symptoms, sore throat, nasal congestion, malaise, myalgia, and headache. Bilateral infiltrates may be seen on chest X-ray. Severe cases may present with sepsis and even shock. Conversely, some patients may present as only mildly ill or asymptomatic altogether. 21 To date, patients with underlying medical conditions and the elderly are more likely to become severely ill, require hospitalization, and ultimately die. 22 Early predictions for incubation time are between 2 and 14 days, based on data from similar coronaviruses. The 14-day criterion for epidemiological risk assumes the longest estimated incubation time. 23 In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) has created its own interim case definition. 24\n\nBy definition, the main features of a novel virus, for example, how it is transmitted, will not be immediately known. However, as with the development of any 3I Tool, it is essential to understand specific characteristics of the disease. In the case of a novel virus such as 2019-CoV, this is challenging since information is rapidly evolving and the science is not yet fully understood. It is possible that the virus will undergo mutations over time that could substantially change its\n\nThe Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus Koenig et al. features. Nevertheless, an appreciation of the key concepts that drive evidence-based management is beneficial (Table 1) . Management guidance will likely change over time.\n\nWith the initial discovery of a new potential public health threat, it will likely be unclear how patients become sick. For example, rather than a contagion, there could be a contaminant or a toxin responsible for signs and symptoms. In this case, the possibility of an environmental toxin in the Wuhan Market was a consideration early on when limited to no human-tohuman transmission was reported. The mode of transmission has implications for the types of personal protective equipment (PPE) needed to protect healthcare providers in the prehospital, clinic, and hospital settings. 25 In addition, patients may need decontamination after exposure to certain toxins. 26 Another important consideration for application of the 3I Tool is whether the disease is contagious prior to symptom onset (like measles) or only after symptoms develop (like Ebola). A January 30, 2020 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine describes a purported confirmed instance of transmission from an asymptomatic individual. Researchers state that, before symptom onset, the primary case infected two individuals, one of which infected two additional colleagues. 27 Subsequent investigation suggested that the source patient did have mild symptoms and had taken an antipyretic, calling this reported asymptomatic transmission into question.\n\nWhile quarantine may not be feasible and can have unintended consequences, 28, 29, 30 it is a public health tool that can be considered in cases when disease is transmissible before symptom onset. 30 Conversely, if a disease is known not to be transmissible prior to symptom onset, asymptomatic exposed patients must be monitored, but do not require quarantine or isolation unless they develop symptoms.\n\nInitially, it may be unclear whether an infectious agent occurred naturally or was deliberately or accidentally released. In this case, a BSL-4 laboratory studying coronaviruses was located approximately 32 kilometers away from the market where initial exposures were felt to occur. 31 Recall that in 2001, the anthrax letter attacks were initially thought to be naturally occurring. Once determined to be bioterrorism, management of the event was similar to that for a chemical exposure with a sudden impact, defined scene, and need for a rapid response and decontamination on site. This differed from the WHO's modeling predicting an aerosolized release that would result in an incubation period with 100,000 or more persons exposed rather than the 22 people who contracted anthrax in 2001. 32 By understanding the key features of a novel disease, healthcare workers can take evidence-based measures to protect themselves, optimize individual patient management, and prevent further disease spread.\n\nIt is currently unclear how 2019-nCoV is spread, but it is suspected to be transmitted through contact with infected respiratory secretions, like other known coronaviruses. There are instances of sustained human-to-human transmission across generations of cases, especially near the epicenter in Wuhan City. 21 Current evidence suggests that close contact with an infected person is a major factor in disease transmission. CDC defines \"close contact\" 33 as being in or within two meters of an area with a confirmed patient or being directly exposed to infectious secretions without appropriate PPE. Healthcare facilities in China have reported spread from person to person. In addition, some mildly ill or potentially even asymptomatic patients may have a higher chance of spreading the disease to others as they may be less likely to seek medical care. 34 The possibility that patients may be infectious prior to symptom onset further compounds the difficulty of containing the virus and effectively preventing transmission.\n\nThe current majority of 2019-nCoV cases have been within China and its bordering countries. 2 Persons with recent travel (within 14 days) to Wuhan City or another region with widespread disease, or exposure to a patient under investigation, are considered to have an epidemiologic risk factor and should be assessed for signs and symptoms of a viral illness such as fever and respiratory symptoms. Coronavirus is a zoonotic virus\n\nThe Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus that is transmitted to humans via contact with infected animals. Preliminary reports suggest the disease may have originated in a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan City, but it is still unknown how or whether such transmission occurred.\n\nClinicians working with local public health departments must arrange to have specimens from patients under investigation (PUIs) sent to the CDC laboratory. At this time, the CDC has the only laboratory that can definitively test for 2019-nCoV, though laboratory testing capacity is being rapidly expanded. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays conducted on samples from a patient's upper and lower respiratory tracts will be used to confirm potential cases. In addition, serum antibody titers can be analyzed for confirmation of infection or evidence of immunity. Up-to-date information about the needed specimens and handling requirements to test for 2019-nCoV are available on the CDC website. 35\n\nLike other related coronaviruses, patients with 2019-nCoV frequently present with non-specific symptoms resembling that of influenza. Physicians may consider differential diagnoses related to a wide variety of respiratory infections. In order to relate these symptoms to 2019-nCoV, it is imperative that the identification of a potential exposure event (epidemiologic risk factor) within 14 days of symptom onset is made so that a more focused work-up for 2019-nCoV can be completed. Although the likelihood of coinfection of 2019-nCoV and another respiratory virus is thought to be low, a positive finding of another respiratory pathogen does not exclude the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV. Many commercially available respiratory panels include \"coronavirus\" in the results, but neither a positive nor a negative finding on these panels should be used to include or exclude a diagnosis of 2019-nCoV.\n\nSupportive care with appropriate infection control is the mainstay of current CDC treatment guidelines for 2019-nCoV. There are not yet any approved antiviral treatments for 2019-nCoV. Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for compassionate use cases may be forthcoming from the US federal government for normally unapproved treatments. Supportive treatment predominantly includes respiratory support, hydration, and antipyretics. General treatment for severe cases should focus on the preservation of vital organ function. In the future, antiviral medications may be available. If a secondary bacterial infection such as pneumonia develops, targeted antibiotics are indicated.\n\nPrevention of 2019-nCoV transmission, like any other infectious agent, involves minimizing risk of exposure. Vaccines are under accelerated development and may be useful in the future for post-exposure prophylaxis. Healthcare personnel are at increased risk and should practice standard, droplet, and airborne precautions when encountering an infected person, a PUI, or any symptomatic close contacts. Healthcare workers handling specimens should also adhere to CDC guidelines and should not attempt to perform any virus isolation or characterization.\n\nFever screening has been implemented at numerous airports, including major international hubs within Asia and the US. The efficacy of this intervention is not well documented, however, as some infected persons may be afebrile and disease transmission might occur prior to symptom onset. 27 In addition, people can artificially lower their temperature readings, e.g., by applying ice to their foreheads.\n\nAs outlined above, admission criteria for 2019-nCoV are similar to that of other patients. If patients do not meet medical criteria for hospitalization, they may be discharged home with isolation precautions and continued observation. EPs must notify local public health authorities so appropriate monitoring and community protective measures can be instituted.\n\nThe Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool was initially developed for Ebola virus disease 10,11 and later adapted for measles, 12 MERS, 13 mumps, 14 Zika virus disease, 15 hepatitis A, 16 pertussis, 17 and scabies. 18 This novel tool for suspected 2019-nCoV patients ( Figure 1 ) provides frontline clinicians with a simple algorithm to manage an emerging disease. Identification of exposed patients with an epidemiologic risk factor within 14 days of symptom onset is a crucial first step. An automatic prompt in the electronic health record can be useful in assisting clinicians with early identification of patients at risk. Case definitions promulgated by the WHO 24 and CDC 33 provide useful comprehensive definitions that have been incorporated into the 3I Tool. The 2019-nCoV Tool provides an accurate, summarized algorithm to immediately, and effectively manage suspected patients until additional resources can be consulted.\n\nPatients who do not have an exposure risk or any symptoms may be triaged normally. However, before making patient contact, providers must first apply the Vital Sign Zero concept. 36 Vital Sign Zero is a preliminary, non-contact assessment (i.e., performed prior to touching a patient to take traditional vital signs) to first determine whether specific PPE is indicated before the examination commences. By taking the additional time to complete this assessment, risk of exposure and further transmission can be minimized. while in the treatment facility should be started and maintained to assist with the possibility of contact tracing. Following isolation, physicians should immediately inform the appropriate authorities. Patients who do not meet medical criteria for admission can be isolated at home during the evaluation phase. 37 Health department officials can help prevent transmission in isolated patients by providing in-home monitoring and implementing appropriate exposure-control measures.\n\nProviders in the prehospital setting who have a high likelihood of encountering 2019-nCoV patients, such as those near international ports of entry, should adhere to established exposure control guidelines. 38 Along with appropriate PPE, providers should also carry thermometers to quantify any fever. In the US, providers should contact the appropriate CDC quarantine station upon isolation of infected or suspected patients, especially those from Wuhan, China or other regions with widespread disease, who report symptoms in the last 14 days. As for other infectious diseases, assessing travel history is essential. Dispatch protocols have been instituted to facilitate identification of callers to 911 or the country-equivalent emergency number prior to prehospital personnel arrival. 39 In addition, CDC has promulgated EMS guidelines for prehospital PPE, transportation of PUIs, vehicle decontamination, and 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) for 2019-nCoV. 40\n\n2019-nCoV is an emerging infectious disease with rapidly evolving features, the full scope of which will be defined over time. Prior outbreaks of coronaviruses can help inform needed actions in the short term to assist with both treatment of individual patients and prevention of global disease spread. This adaptation of the Identify-Isolate-Inform Tool serves as a resource for healthcare workers who need to make clear, rapid assessments when confronted with potential patients.

The thousands of Yemeni and Congolese who have died in these years-long epidemics demonstrate the difficulty of combatting even well-known pathogens in humanitarian settings. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) may represent a still greater threat to those in complex humanitarian crises, which lack the infrastructure, support, and health systems to mount a comprehensive response. Poor governance, public distrust, and political violence may further undermine interventions in these settings.\n\nPopulations affected by humanitarian crises are expected to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, due to displacement, crowded housing, malnutrition, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) tools, and stigmatization. Disease outbreaks further reduce access to limited healthcare, which is increasingly disrupted by attacks on health facilities and the persistent overburdening of health systems. These situations escalate both the necessity and the difficulty of delivering accurate and actionable information to potentially affected populations [3] .\n\nAs the international community responds to SARS-CoV-2, public health authorities in humanitarian crises begin at a disadvantage to enact appropriate infection control to prevent transmission in healthcare settings, identify infectious cases, administer supportive care and novel treatments for the seriously ill, and trace contacts. These standard public health measures are particularly difficult to perform in humanitarian settings. For example, limited public health, laboratory, and primary care services represent a barrier to testing. Providing the limited healthcare worker cadre with appropriate training and personal protective equipment, and ensuring a continuous supply chain for such, is a challenge in all settings, exacerbated in complex humanitarian crises. Frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing. Finally, intractable structural challenges such as overcrowding limit the implementation of both quarantine of those exposed and isolation of those who are ill. Given these increased vulnerabilities, humanitarian crises should be viewed as a priority for national and international bodies that seek to combat this unfolding pandemic. Resources must be identified to protect healthcare workers, develop and deploy rapid testing, improve surveillance, and enact quarantine and isolation of contacts and cases.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on crisesaffected populations, governments and agencies will implement the familiar, global evidence-based approaches for combatting respiratory viruses. Respiratory hygiene is a highly effective public health intervention, supported by evidence demonstrating that the spread of respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be prevented by hand hygiene, safe cough practice, and social distancing [4] . Hand hygiene is a readily implemented behavior: the distribution of soap to households in humanitarian settings has been shown to increase handwashing by over 30% [5] . Furthermore, hand hygiene is an avenue of agency for protecting one's own health, consistent with the rights to dignity and to fully participate in decisions related to assistance in humanitarian crises. Widespread introduction of alcohol-based hand rubs is also possible in many resource-limited settings, with published protocols for local production [6] .\n\nThe Sphere Handbook, a collection of rights-based guidelines for humanitarian response, is the foremost authority on minimum standards for humanitarian assistance [7] . However, despite the indisputable evidence for the efficacy of hand hygiene for reducing both bacterial and viral pathogen transmission, humanitarian WASH standards are based on evidence pertaining to the prevention of illnesses transmitted by the faecal-oral route, with the focus on hand hygiene proximate to latrines [5, 8] . And yet, latrines in crisis settings are often shared and distant from residential shelters, conferring a high risk of gender-based violence [9] . Gender-based violence around latrines is an important deterrent for accessing latrine-adjacent handwashing stations, particularly for hand hygiene to prevent respiratory pathogen transmission.\n\nEvidence-based guidelines alone in complex humanitarian crises may not suffice during the emergence of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Without the adaptation of existing standards, mitigation plans will fall short of health and human rights obligations in outbreak response. Crisis-affected community engagement is integral in pandemic planning, in order to maximize the real-world effectiveness of efficacious interventions. Transparent and credible information-sharing mechanisms are increasingly essential when pandemics threaten vulnerable populations [10] . Diplomacy bridging long-standing mistrust of public health and biomedical interventions and facilitating engagement with contentious actors is a necessary component of effective health governance in complex crisis settings [2] . Interventions tailored to the needs of crisis-affected populations, delivered with transparent information, in the context of inclusive governance practices, are urgently needed in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "document_id": 2643}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Approximately how many people died during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic?", "id": 259, "answers": [{"text": "During the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, between 21 and 25 million people died of influenza worldwide.", "answer_start": 1998}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What social and economic factors  contributed to the large fatality rate in the 1918 influenza pandemic?", "id": 286, "answers": [{"text": "Malnutrition weakened the human immune system and made a person more vulnerable to infectious diseases like tuberculosis and influenza, therefore, hunger and malnutrition were indirectly responsible for millions of deaths in the world in that period of time.", "answer_start": 1637}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What problems were faced by medical staff during the 1918 epidemic?", "id": 291, "answers": [{"text": " in 1918 and 1919, physicians and nurses almost had nothing in their hands to help individuals who were infected by influenza viruses.

Influenza viruses had caused a pandemic globally during 1918 and 1919, and that influenza pandemic had taken away more than 20 million people's lives in the world. However, in my opinion, it is unlikely that influenza viruses will again cause a pandemic on a level (both of the morbidity rate and the mortality rate) comparable to what happened in 1918 and 1919.\n\nInfluenza viruses very easily reassort, recombine, and point mutate in nature due to their segmented RNA genome structures, however, unlike highly pathogenic (virulent) viruses like rabies virus, Lassa fever virus, smallpox virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1); most influenza viruses (wild types and mutants) are moderately pathogenic. The case fatality rates of some highly virulent viruses and related references are listed in Table 1 .\n\nOn November 11, 1918 , the fighting of World War I was stopped, and World War I was officially ended on June 28, 1919 with the signing of the Versailles Treaty. It is estimated that around 8.5-10 million soldiers lost their lives in World War I due to battle. The war also directly caused more than 6 million civilian deaths. Millions of people suffered from hunger and malnutrition during the war. Malnutrition weakened the human immune system and made a person more vulnerable to infectious diseases like tuberculosis and influenza, therefore, hunger and malnutrition were indirectly responsible for millions of deaths in the world in that period of time. For example, about 700,000 Germans died from malnutrition-related diseases in the years of 1914-1918. During the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, between 21 and 25 million people died of influenza worldwide. Those people were killed both directly and indirectly by influenza virus infections. Many families were too poor to buy food and coal, and to afford health care expenses when their family members were ill. Influenza virus could infect all members of a family, and this could result in no one left to feed the fires, and to prepare food for the whole family, even if they had firewood, coal, and food left in their homes. Sadly, a large number of people died of influenza virus infections along with starvation, cold, and poor living conditions (8) .\n\nIn recent years, while hunger and malnutrition are not major and serious problems in some developed countries anymore, they are still very difficult to overcome in many developing countries. In these less-developed countries, there were approximately 925 million people who suffered from hunger; 125 million children were underweight; and 195 million children were stunted each year (9) . Nevertheless, in comparison to 1918 and 1919, currently, we have much better social and economic conditions and public health systems globally; and generally speaking, the majority of people in the world have better nutritional and educational statuses; better living and working conditions; therefore, better general health and immunity. Furthermore, in 1918 and 1919, physicians and nurses almost had nothing in their hands to help individuals who were infected by influenza viruses. Today, although we still do not have very effective, powerful, and practical anti-influenza drugs available, we at least have some improved, useful, and helpful anti-viral drugs like zanamivir, and effective, convenient anti-cold medicines like Tylenol or Advil. We do not have a universal vaccine to prevent all influenza virus infections, but we can make effective vaccines to a specific influenza virus strain in a short time. Actually, in the United States of America, the influenza classed mortality rate declined from 10.2/100,000 in the 1940s to 0.56/100,000 in the 1990s; and the classed mortality rates of 1957-1958 and 1968-1969 influenza pandemics were not remarkably different from the non-pandemic seasons (10) .\n\nBecause of the above reasons, we can optimistically assume that even the same strain of influenza virus, which caused pandemic in 1918 and 1919, would not be able to kill millions of people and cause a pandemic comparable to the 1918-1919 pandemic again in the future.\n\nAdditionally, a significant number of viruses can cause influenza-like syndromes, such as rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Coxsackie B virus, echovirus, and metapneumovirus (11, 12) . Some of the above-mentioned viruses like adenovirus and mutated coronavirus could cause problems that are comparable to influenza viruses (13, 14) .\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) mistakenly raised the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 5 to the highest phase 6 on June 11, 2009 (15) . However, the truth was that most cases of H1N1 influenza A virus infections were mild, the symptomatic case fatality rate was only 0.005% in New Zealand (16) ; and in New York City, the case fatality rate was 0.0094-0.0147% for persons \u226565 years old, and for those of 0-17 years old, the case fatality rate was 0.0008-0.0012% (17) . Some researchers argued that it should not have been called an influenza pandemic in the first place if the clinical severity was considered (15, (18) (19) (20) . I believe it was unwise that we had paid too much www.frontiersin.org 23) . Not surprisingly, every year there would be some influenza patients and a few of them would die from the infections, as it is almost impossible to eliminate influenza viruses from the natural environment in many years. The severity of a viral infection is determined by both of the viral virulence (pathogenicity) and the host immunity. Some researchers' opinions on H7N9 avian influenza virus were incorrect and/or inadequate. They mainly focused on influenza viruses and worried about viral mutations, viral pathogenicity, viral adaptation, and transmission. They overestimated the negative part of socio-economic factors of the present east China: overcrowded population in the epidemic region; very busy national and international transportation and travel; a large number of live poultry markets . . . but they underestimated the currently changed, developed, and improved positive part of socio-economic factors in China. The following factors might be used to explain why that H7N9 influenza A virus epidemic was limited and controlled in China, and only a few immunocompromised patients were killed by H7N9 influenza A virus. First, China has a relatively organized and effective public health system, there are four levels of (national, provincial, prefectural-level city, and county) centers for disease control and prevention all over China (24) . Second, physicians and nurses in China were prepared and knowledgeable of influenza virus infections. Third, samples from patients with suspected influenza virus infections were collected and sent to the local and national centers for disease control and prevention promptly. H7N9 influenza A viruses were isolated and identified very quickly. Thereby, they were able to diagnose, confirm, and report three cases of H7N9 influenza patients in the early stage of the epidemic (24, 25) . Fourth, health care and public health workers were protected properly. Consequently, none of the health professionals was infected by H7N9 influenza A virus in 2013. However, a surgeon died of H7N9 influenza in Shanghai, China in January of 2014 (26) . Fifth, they detected H7N9 influenza A viruses from the samples of chickens, pigeons, and the environment of live poultry markets in Shanghai (27) ; and closed the live poultry markets of the involved epidemic region quickly. Sixth, patients were isolated and treated timely in hospitals, 74% (1251/1689) of those close contacts of H7N9 influenza patients were monitored and observed. Thus, H7N9 influenza A virus could not spread to a bigger population (24) . Last but not least, we are connected to the Internet now, and it seems that our planet is much smaller today than the earlier days when we did not have the Internet, because communication and information exchange have become so fast, easy, and convenient presently. During that avian influenza epidemic, some influenza experts in the world shared/exchanged H7N9 influenza A virus information and provided professional consultations and suggestions efficiently and rapidly. All these public health routine practices and measures resulted in that H7N9 influenza epidemic being controlled and stopped in China (24) . I have to point out that the cases of diagnosed H7N9 avian influenza A virus infection might only be the tip of the iceberg. Aside from one laboratory confirmed asymptotic case of H7N9 influenza A virus infection in Beijing (22), there were probably many undetected mild or asymptotic cases of influenza A H7N9 infection. The reason is that most people usually think a common cold is a very common and normal occurrence, and they don't take flu-like illnesses seriously. In most situations, they would just stay home and take some medicines. Only those who have very severe flu-like symptoms would see doctors, and thereby be detected and diagnosed, accordingly the real case fatality rate should be much lower than the detected 32.14% (45/140, one case from Taiwan, and one case from Hong Kong) (22, 23).\n\nNowadays, we travel faster, and we travel more frequently and globally, and we have more complicated social activities and lifestyles, thereby increasing the chances of viral mutation; and we realize that influenza viruses are even easier to reassort, recombine, and mutate in nature than many other RNA viruses. However, we are now living in a technologically, economically, and socially much better and advanced society. I believe influenza virus infections are controllable and preventable, with the increased population health and immunity, with the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, and with standard/routine epidemiological practices, and with new effective anti-viral agents and vaccines in production in the future. Now, I first predict that influenza viruses will unlikely again cause a pandemic on a level comparable to what happened in 1918 and 1919. Hopefully, one day we could consider a strategy to produce a universal vaccine that can prevent people from infections of all influenza virus strains, or we could produce some very effective anti-influenza virus drugs; then influenza would not be a problem anymore. We should learn lessons from the mistakes we made in the past. It is reasonable and necessary to be cautious about influenza viruses, but overreactions or catastrophic reactions should be avoided in the future. My opinion is anti-traditional; the purpose of this article is to influence public health policy, and to save some of the limited resources and money for more important diseases like heart diseases, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, hepatitises, and tuberculosis (15) .\n\nLiting Song: conception of manuscript, drafting of manuscript, critical revision of manuscript, and final approval of manuscript.\n\nThe author would like to recognize the contributions of the reviewers and editors of this manuscript for their corrections and editing, and Dr. Emanuel Goldman for correcting errors related to grammar and syntax of the final manuscript.", "document_id": 776}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the structure of the Ebolavirus?", "id": 5315, "answers": [{"text": "single-strand RNA filoviruses", "answer_start": 2270}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the West African Ebolavirus outbreak?", "id": 5316, "answers": [{"text": "2013-2016", "answer_start": 2546}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What animals are considered to be maintenance hosts to the Ebolavirus?", "id": 5317, "answers": [{"text": "African bats", "answer_start": 4083}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do circles indicate in Figure 1?", "id": 5318, "answers": [{"text": "a maintenance function play by the host(s)", "answer_start": 7212}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do arrows indicate in Figure 1?", "id": 5319, "answers": [{"text": "infectious transmission pathways between hosts", "answer_start": 7273}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Ebola Virus Maintenance: If Not (Only) Bats, What Else?\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213544/\n\nSHA: f16da7cf7a952fb981dfc0d77280aac9c3ab933a\n\nAuthors: Caron, Alexandre; Bourgarel, Mathieu; Cappelle, Julien; Li\u00e9geois, Florian; De Nys, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne M.; Roger, Fran\u00e7ois\nDate: 2018-10-09\nDOI: 10.3390/v10100549\nLicense: cc-by\n\nAbstract: The maintenance mechanisms of ebolaviruses in African forest ecosystems are still unknown, but indirect evidences point at the involvement of some bat species. Despite intense research, the main bat-maintenance hypothesis has not been confirmed yet. The alternative hypotheses of a non-bat maintenance host or a maintenance community including, or not, several bat and other species, deserves more investigation. However, African forest ecosystems host a large biodiversity and abound in potential maintenance hosts. How does one puzzle out? Since recent studies have revealed that several bat species have been exposed to ebolaviruses, the common denominator to these hypotheses is that within the epidemiological cycle, some bats species must be exposed to the viruses and infected by these potential alternative hosts. Under this constraint, and given the peculiar ecology of bats (roosting behaviour, habitat utilisation, and flight mode), we review the hosts and transmission pathways that can lead to bat exposure and infection to ebolaviruses. In contrast to the capacity of bats to transmit ebolaviruses and other pathogens to many hosts, our results indicate that only a limited number of hosts and pathways can lead to the transmission of ebolaviruses to bats, and that the alternative maintenance host, if it exists, must be amongst them. A list of these pathways is provided, along with protocols to prioritise and investigate these alternative hypotheses. In conclusion, taking into account the ecology of bats and their known involvement in ebolaviruses ecology drastically reduces the list of potential alternative maintenance hosts for ebolaviruses. Understanding the natural history of ebolaviruses is a health priority, and investigating these alternative hypotheses could complete the current effort focused on the role of bats.\n\nText: Ebolaviruses (EBVs), according to Kuhn et al. classification [1] ) are single-strand RNA filoviruses that can induce a high mortality in some hosts, including apes and humans [2, 3] . The different ebolaviruses have caused localised but dramatic human outbreaks, mainly in Central Africa, in the last 40 years. The recent West African outbreak in 2013-2016 gave an outline of the pandemic potential of these pathogens [4, 5] .\n\nDisentangling the complexity of maintenance hosts or communities in multi-host systems at the wildlife/livestock/human interface is a difficult task [16] [17] [18] . The maintenance of EBV in equatorial forests is yet to be understood. Some mammal species played a major role in triggering human outbreaks: apes such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes and P. t. verus) and western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were at the origin of several human outbreaks [10] [11] [12] , but have been found to be highly susceptible to EBV with potential drastic impact for their populations [12, 19] . EBOV PCR positive duiker carcasses (Cephalophus sp.) have also been found [20] . One would not expect such a high mortality (relative to their population density) of EBOV in maintenance hosts. However, these data indicate their possible involvement in the transmission function of EBOV, bridging the maintenance host with human populations during a spillover event [18] (Figure 1 ). The EBOV susceptibility and exposure (tested by virology, serology and/or PCR) of many other potential forest hosts, including invertebrates, birds, bats, monkeys, rodents, and other small mammals, have been tested in the field or experimentally with an interestingly large amount of negative results (e.g., [12, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] ). A few monkey and bat individuals serologically positive to EBV antigen represent the only exceptions [12] .\n\nToday, African bats are considered by many as the best candidates for acting as maintenance hosts for EBOV. Partial vRNA was sequenced from living specimens of three different bat species in Central Africa [23] , and antibodies against ebolavirus antigen have been detected in 9 bat species (8 frugivorous and 1 insectivorous) [3, 23, [27] [28] [29] [30] . Recently, a new ebolavirus species with an unknown pathogenic risk has also been isolated from two insectivorous bat species roosting inside a house [31] . Moreover, Swanepoel et al. showed that EBOV replicated in three species of experimentally infected bats (Tadarida condylura, Tadarida pumila, and Epomophorus wahlbergi), including virus isolated from faeces 21 days after experimental infection [22] . In addition, some bat species have been shown to act as maintenance hosts for multiple RNA viruses, including filoviruses (e.g., [32] [33] [34] ). However, to date, no EBOV replicative strain has been isolated from healthy wild bats despite thousands of individuals tested [14, [23] [24] [25] 28, 34, 35] . Given the current knowledge, the main hypotheses for EBOV maintenance are a single bat species as Rousettus aegyptiacus is considered the maintenance host for Marburg virus ( Figure 1A1 ); or a network of interacting bat species creating a maintenance community for EBOV ( Figure 1A2 ).\n\nThe bat system is complex. First, for its diversity: globally, they represent over 20% of the mammal diversity, forming the second largest mammalian order after rodents, and Africa hosts 317 known living species, 25% of the global bat diversity [36] . Secondly, bats have exceptional lifestyles that have already been reviewed, especially in relation to their role in disease ecology [33, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . They are unique mammal species regrouping such peculiar life history traits as their aerial life mode, their longevity, their gregarious and migration patterns, as well as their immune system. bridging the maintenance host with human populations during a spillover event [18] (Figure 1 ). The EBOV susceptibility and exposure (tested by virology, serology and/or PCR) of many other potential forest hosts, including invertebrates, birds, bats, monkeys, rodents, and other small mammals, have been tested in the field or experimentally with an interestingly large amount of negative results (e.g., [12, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] ). A few monkey and bat individuals serologically positive to EBV antigen represent the only exceptions [12] .\n\nPotential maintenance mechanisms of ebolaviruses in wildlife, according to current knowledge. Circles (plain or dotted) indicate a maintenance function play by the host(s); arrows represent infectious transmission pathways between hosts. Humans, non-human primates, and duikers are examples of known non-maintenance hosts, exposed occasionally to ebolavirus directly or indirectly through the main maintenance host.

Humans, non-human primates, and duikers are examples of known non-maintenance hosts, exposed occasionally to ebolavirus directly or indirectly through the main maintenance host. (A1) Main maintenance hypothesis: there is one bat species maintaining each ebolavirus alone. Currently this is logically the most investigated hypothesis given the available data, and represents the maintenance mechanism for another filovirus, the Marburg virus, as currently understood. (A2) Several bat species are needed to create a maintenance community for Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV); each bat species cannot complete EBOV maintenance alone, as it requires interactions with the other species. (B) Alternate non-bat maintenance host hypothesis: if it exists, it is known that it can transmit ebolaviruses to some bat species. In this article, we review the potential hosts and associated transmission pathways that link this host to bat species (red arrow). (C) The maintenance community hypothesis, in which several hosts are needed to maintain ebolaviruses (ellipses represent different scenarios of community maintenance). This could be one or more alternative hosts involving possibly bat species. By definition, if such an alternative host exists, there are infectious transmission pathways from this host towards bats that are reviewed here (red arrows).\n\nProving that a bat species maintains EBOV (e.g., [44, 45] ), or that interconnected populations of different bat species create the cradle for EBOV maintenance in a specific ecosystem, is a difficult task. Finding a live virus in a healthy bat specimen would constitute a great step in proving that this particular species is part or the totality of the EBOV maintenance. However, this finding would also trigger new questions: does this species act alone to maintain EBOV, or do other sympatric bat species' populations create a maintenance community for EBOV? Is this EBOV maintenance system unique or ecosystem specific? Additionally, are other non-bat species involved in the maintenance? The road to identifying the maintenance host(s) of EBOV is still long.\n\nThe gaps in knowledge concerning the maintenance of EBOV and other EBV are therefore still significant. Available data indicates a systematic but weak signal in some bat species, a pattern in line with the main bat maintenance hypotheses, but not excluding as well alternative hypotheses as presented in Figure 1B ,C. If those alternative scenarios do not necessarily agree with the Occam's razor principle, they still cannot be ignored by the scientific community. African forest ecosystems host a high diversity of organisms relative to other ecosystems, and provide a rich pool of candidate species for playing a role in EBOV maintenance. EBOV specialists agree in calling for more integrated efforts across scientific fields, notably epidemiology, ecology, molecular biology, remote sensing modelling, and social sciences to test new hypotheses [39] . We provide, here, an ecological perspective on the EBOV multi-host system to provide a hypothesis-driven framework for future work. There is still a possibility that bats are not part of or that non-bat species are involved in the EBOV maintenance system and alternative scenarios should be considered and explored ( Figure 1 ) [46] . These scenarios should be investigated, when possible, alongside bat-centred protocols, to confirm or invalidate the case for bats as EBOV maintenance hosts.\n\nWhen a probability P is difficult or impossible to estimate, it is sometimes easier to estimate its inverse probability (1-P), the probability that it does not happen. It would be tedious to quantitatively estimate probabilities in the case of ebolavirus maintenance given the current lack of information, but trying to define the components of this probability could help. Hence, instead of proving that bats are the maintenance host for EBOV, what if we consider that \"bats are not the (only) maintenance host for EBOV\"?\n\nHere, we consider the scenario presented in Figure 1B ,C, namely, that bats are not the maintenance host for EBOV or that bat species are involved with alternative host(s) in the EBOV maintenance community. Current data and knowledge support both scenarios. Some bats are sometimes in contact with the virus and experience waves of exposure during outbreaks [27] . Once infected, bats could either be dead-end hosts, as some experimental studies suggest that some bat species cannot excrete the virus [47] ); or they could transmit viruses to other hosts, such as primates including humans [6, 48, 49] as a bridge host, linking the maintenance host with humans. This means based on the definition of a bridge host [18] , that these bats must have been in contact, at some point in the epidemiological cycle, with the maintenance host (or another bridge host) to get the EBOV infection. Here, \"contact\" means infectious contact, and can be direct (e.g., physical) or indirect (e.g., through the environment). The search for alternative maintenance hosts for EBOV should, therefore, concentrate on hosts that can transmit the virus to bats. In other words, any host that could not transmit the virus to bats would be ineligible to be a maintenance host for EBOV. This holds for any host found exposed to EBOV (e.g., some duiker sp.) but the focus on bats is justified in the following section.\n\nThe ecology of most African bat species is largely unknown. It can still be summarised as follows: roosting in trees (hanging or in holes) or caves, flying, eating insects while flying (insectivorous bats)/eating fruits in trees (fruit bat), flying back and roosting in trees or caves; with biannual long-range migration or nomadic movements for some species [50] . A single bat can cover a large variety of habitats and even regions for those migrating. Therefore, the transmission pathways from bats to other animals through urine, saliva, birthing fluids, and placental material and/or guano could be important (see review on Ebola isolated from body tissues and fluids [51] ). Predation is also a less known but potential transmission pathway from bats to predators [48, 52] . The range of potential species at risk of infection from bats is thus large [53] . However, the range of potential transmission pathways available for the maintenance or bridge host (under scenario B and C in Figure 1 ) to infect bats seems to be much more limited. For example, bats seldom use the ground floor: transmission routes requiring direct contact or environmental transmission on the ground do not expose bats. In other terms, direct contacts with strictly ground-dwelling animals would be very unlikely. Four habitat types structure the various transmission pathways from the alternative host to bats (and each bat species will frequent only a fraction of these habitats: (i) open air while flying, for insectivorous bats also while feeding; (ii) surface water when drinking; (iii) cave roofs and walls as roost habitat; (iv) tree canopy for roosting or feeding. From these four habitats, potential transmission routes to infect bats from other hosts can be inferred (Table 1 ). In the following sections, the different transmission pathways that can link potential alternative hosts to bats are listed and discussed, along with examples of these alternative hosts. \n\nFirstly, EBOV transmission to bats could occur through aerosol transmission in all four habitats. This means that the maintenance host would release, in bats' airspace, enough EBOV to contaminate bats. In theory, this would be possible in most bat environments, but we have discarded open-air transmission (e.g., in-flight bird to bat transmission) as the load of virus in the air cannot reach the levels that ensure infection. However, in the confined atmosphere of caves, bat to human transmission of rabies has been suspected [54] [55] [56] . EBOV and other filovirus particles seem to be able to persist for at least 90 min as aerosol [57, 71] , and experimental studies conducted on non-human primates (NHPs) by inoculating EBOV via the aerosol route were able to induce fatal disease 5 to 12 days post-inoculation [58] . Experimental airborne transmission of EBOV between animals from different species, e.g., from pigs to non-human primates, also seems possible [74] . In caves, the aerosol route might thus be possible. However, as bats tend to roost aggregated in groups and sometimes in large colonies, the ambient air may be saturated by bats' aerosols, rather than an alternative host. Air screening could be attempted in bat habitats but experimental aerosol transmission trials from alternative hosts to bats would be more efficient.\n\nBats are exposed to ectoparasitism [61] . If the biting invertebrate has previously bitten the alternative maintenance host, it could, in principle, infect bats. Hematophagous insects have been screened for EBOV during or after outbreaks with no conclusive results [26, 75] . However, absence of exposure during an outbreak does not mean that the host is not involved in the maintenance of the virus in-between outbreaks. For example, the process of amplification in disease ecology can involve different hosts than maintenance hosts. Little information is available on ticks in bats. Ticks have been suggested to be involved in the transmission of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever-like viruses to bats [76] , and are seriously considered as potential hosts for the transmission of other pathogens from non-bat hosts to bats. Mosquitos could also be a vessel for a vector-borne transmission of EBOV. Studies on mosquito blood meals have revealed that mosquito could feed on bats and other mammals [62, 63] . Bat flies appear to be highly bat-specific, adapted to their lifestyle [77] [78] [79] [80] and are involved in the transmission of pathogens [64] . However, this specificity would preclude interspecies pathogen transmission. Ectoparasitism provides a potential solid source of indirect contacts between the alternative maintenance host and bats. This transmission pathway should be explored much further, and ecological insights, including insect and bat behavioural ecology, will be necessary to target the right insect species within the diversity of available biting species, in the right habitat (e.g., tree canopy level, caves' roofs, when bats are immobile) at a proper time (e.g., nocturnal behaviour of bats) and season, when both hosts (i.e., the maintenance host and bats) can be fed upon by the vector. To our knowledge, such targeted protocols have not been implemented so far.\n\nInsectivorous bats feed on insects that could be a source of EBOV [61] . This food-borne route has been little investigated as well. A recent study pointed out the role of insect-specific viruses in the evolution of numerous viral families, including mononegaviruses, which infect vertebrates [81] . There is a possibility that prey-insects are the maintenance host for EBOV [61] . Insect vectors, such as blood feeding insects (e.g., mosquitos) could also, in theory, transport viruses in their blood meal after a bite on an infected host. They have been suspected in other filovirus outbreaks in the past [82] . In theory, these insects preyed upon by bats could also link bats to any type of maintenance host they could feed on. Bats actively search for prey in many different habitats hosting hematophagous insects that feed on habitat-specific fauna. Moreover, Reiskind et al. suggested that blood fed female mosquitos are more susceptible to predation [66] . Leendertz et al. also suggested that the population dynamics of mayflies may act as a driver of EBOV emergence in mammals and humans [46] . Insectivorous bat diet analysis could, therefore, indicate the relative proportion of hematophagous insect fed upon by bats and their identity, in order to subsequently target these insect species for sampling.\n\nThe EBOV maintenance host could shed viable viruses in the environment where bats could get infected by environmental exposure. The most likely habitats where this can happen are tree canopies and holes, and cave roofs/walls used only by a fraction of hosts inhabiting forests. The probability of infection will be dependent on the capacity of the virus to survive in the environmental conditions available in the specific habitat. Therefore, a better understanding of the capacity of EBOV to survive under different biotic and abiotic conditions is important to explore further (e.g., [71, 73] ). These experimental approaches should consider the specific environmental conditions occurring in the tree canopy and cave roofs in terms of substrate, temperature, humidity and light properties.\n\nOne particular mechanism that has been put forward in the literature is the fruit-borne route concerning frugivorous bats in the tree canopy. The availability of fruits attracts fruit-eating animals, including birds, tree-dwelling mammals, and invertebrates. This behaviour can create a network of contacts between hosts, leading to several transmission pathways, and this interaction network can be denser during seasons with food resource limitations [23, 27] . Indirect contacts through faecal material, urine, or saliva left on fruits or branches could link the maintenance host with bats, in the same way that bats have been shown to be able to transmit other viruses (e.g., henipaviruses) through body fluids on fruit [33, 70, 83] . EBOV and filoviruses have been shown to persist for some time (3 to 7 days) in the environment, depending on the biotic and abiotic conditions [71] [72] [73] . In addition, EBV can be shed in some bat faeces [22] (but not all, [47] ), and have been cultured from human urine and saliva [51] , hence, could also be transmitted from faeces, urine, and saliva from other species. This transmission route is therefore possible, but restrained to the fauna feeding at the same height as bats (or, technically, above). The hypothesis of fruits soiled with infected body fluids falling on the ground and opening a transmission pathway towards other ground-level foraging hosts (e.g., duikers) does not expose bats to the alternative maintenance hosts (e.g., [83] ).\n\nA relation between river systems and EBOV outbreaks has been suggested in Central Africa, with tributaries influencing the spatial distribution of cases [84] . If river systems can harbour specific biotic communities with potential alternative hosts, such as water-dependent vectors [46] , they can also represent, in remote forest ecosystems, the main transport pathways for people, providing a means for pathogens to spread through infected people or their hunted animals. Of course, in principle, while drinking, bats could get infected if the virus is present at the surface of the water. The capacity of EBOV to survive in the water has been the focus of a recent experimental study reporting an EBOV survival in water of 4 to 7 days between 21 and 27 \u2022 C [72] . Bats usually drink in open water, and not on the shores where viruses could be more concentrated by the presence of the maintenance host, for example. A dilution effect expected in open water, relative to some shallow water near the shores, would not favour such a transmission route a priori.\n\nTree and cave roosts could expose hanging and resting bats to direct contact with a potential maintenance host. However, as a first observation, the upside-down vertical position of bat roosting does not really favour disease transmission from an alternative host. For bat species roosting in tree-holes, the situation can be different as they can share temporally or directly their nest space with other animals [85] . Secondly, the density of bats roosting in caves prevents the presence of many other potential hosts in the cave roof (but, for example, snakes can predate on bats in caves). During their feeding behaviour, frugivorous bats could be in direct contact with other hosts attracted by the fruits. Their nocturnal habits will limit the diversity of host they can interact with. We are not aware of any extensive study on the network of potential contacts between bats and other animals during their roosting and feeding behaviour. The majority of studies investigated potential of infectious contact from bats to other organisms [53] . Novel technologies, such as camera traps equipped with nocturnal vision, could provide opportunities for more research on this topic.\n\nAs the ecology of most Africa bats is unknown, other opportunities exposing bat to potential maintenance hosts may be discovered in the future. For example, some bat species feed on fish [86] and, more recently, using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen as dietary tracers, it was demonstrated that a bat species, Nyctalus lasiopterus, was seasonally feeding on migrating Palearctic birds [87] , a feeding behaviour unknown until now. Failed predation on bats could also be a rare opportunity for infectious transmission [52] .\n\nConsidering the scenario B and C in Figure 1 , that bats are not the maintenance hosts of EBOV or that they are not the only host involved in the maintenance of EBOV, helps in focusing EBOV research protocols on a reduced range of potential transmission routes and potential alternative hosts interacting with bats in their specific and limited habitats. This means that if bats are not the maintenance hosts for EBOV, then there is only a limited number of candidate species to play the role of alternative maintenance hosts. This limited number of alternative maintenance hosts is defined by the ecology of bats that imposes on those alternative maintenance hosts only a few possible EBOV transmission pathways towards bats. From the biodiversity of African forest and the full web of interactions between species, a set of secondary hypotheses indicated in Table 1 can be tested through protocols presented to further investigate the role of different maintenance host candidates for EBOV. The observation of this limited number of hosts calls for testing them, even if only to exclude them from the list of hypotheses and strengthen the main hypothesis. As warned above, the EBOV multi-host maintenance system could include a complex network of interacting bat species ( Figure 1A2 ) and to proceed by elimination of alternative hypotheses may be a way to zoom-in on the maintenance community. The hypothesis of human playing a role in ebolavirus maintenance has not been addressed here, even if persistence of EBOV in previously infected humans has been recently proven [51] . This scenario would be more indicating of a change in the evolutionary trajectory of the pathogen (as moving from Step 4 to 5 in Figure 1 of Wolfe et al. [88] ) than of the natural maintenance of ebolaviruses that is considered here.\n\nIn order for these protocols to be efficient and well designed, insights from behavioural ecology, plant phenology, and molecular biology (amongst other disciplines) will be necessary. Integrated approaches to health have been proposed recently and, in EBOV ecology, they should promote the integration of ecological sciences into health sciences that are usually at the forefront of epidemiological investigations. For example, a lot of sampling of potential alternative hosts has been undertaken during ebolaviruses outbreaks (e.g., [12, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] ). These investigations concerned mainly the search for \"what transmits ebolaviruses to people\" as they were implemented during a human (or great ape) outbreak, and in the vicinity of outbreaks. This does not mean that they can automatically inform on \"what maintains ebolaviruses\". When looking for the maintenance host, investigations should also target the same and other alternative hosts during inter-outbreak periods with ecologically driven hypotheses. This is what is currently done for bats following the main maintenance hypothesis (e.g., [30] ), but not often for alternative hosts. Experimental trials should also concentrate on the environmental conditions occurring in bat-specific habitats, which can be very different from human outbreak conditions.\n\nThe transmission routes towards bats represent interhost contacts of unknown intensity and frequency, and it would be difficult to compare their relative importance. However, one can prioritize some transmission routes based on the current knowledge. The insect food-borne and vector-borne routes of transmission need, surely, to be further investigated, as they can expose bats to numerous other hosts. Previous works on insects have mainly concentrated on sampling insects in the human outbreaks' surroundings (e.g., [26] ). When searching for a maintenance host that can transmit EBOV to bats, protocols should concentrate on insects in interaction with known-exposed bat species. This would mean combining bat behavioural ecology and arthropod capture protocols to detect their potential carriage of EBOV, as well as protocols exploring bat feeding habits (e.g., molecular detection of prey DNA in bat's guano) [65, 67] . For example, insect captures should be targeted where insects can bite bats, in caves or at canopy level, and not at ground level where bats may not occur. Studying host interaction networks at fruit feeding sites is also an interesting avenue to explore direct, environmental, and fruit-borne routes of transmission. Behavioural ecology could inform and help targeting protocols. Chimpanzees and monkeys can feed at the same height as bats. Some rodent species feed on fruits, but the selection of the arboricolous species feeding at the same height as bats can reduce the list drastically. Camera trap protocols could inform host interaction networks placing bat species in symmetric or asymmetric interactions with other potential alternative hosts.\n\nUnder field reality, and especially in rainforests, this list of protocols will need a carefully designed programme to be successful, rooted in interdisciplinarity. As bats, and especially those species that have been exposed to ebolaviruses, are the entry point of most of these alternative hypotheses (i.e., alternative host need to be in contact with bats), the behavioural and community ecology of targeted bat species will need to be locally understood. Data recorders, such as vector or camera traps, will need to be deployed where bats are currently roosting or feeding. This can be a difficult task. Understanding which feeding resources attract bats at a specific season requires a good understanding of indigenous and domesticated tree phenology (e.g., [89] ). Prior to this work, a guano-based dietary analysis of the feeding behaviour of bats could help to map locally where and when bats will be present. Then, simultaneous protocols on bats and sympatric alternative hosts can be implemented, and a biological search for antibodies or antigens can be implemented. Combining protocols to test the main and alternative hypotheses could provide cost-effective and synergetic options.\n\nTo conclude, alternative hypotheses presented here should be explored alongside efforts to confirm bat species as maintenance hosts for EBOV. The ecology of those bat species already known to be exposed should be used to design protocols in order to target relevant alternative maintenance hosts. Given the number of species already involved/exposed to EBOV, the ecology of EBOV and its maintenance system can be expected to be complex, ecosystem dependent [46] , and dynamic, due to global changes [90] . The Ebola maintenance system, once isolated in the forests, is now interacting with humans and their modified environments and will adapt to it. Aiming at this moving target will require out-of-the-box thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration.", "document_id": 1713}]}]}
